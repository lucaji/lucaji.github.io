# Mytuna


For some years I worked with and published mobile apps. Albeit mostly on the iOS Apple platform, I ventured into porting onto Android (JAVA, Kotlin) as well.
This post lists the apps I worked on, worth of being published. Make sure you check those open-source ones, as their code is available for download.

Unless otherwise stated, I took care of
- designing all the graphical elements of the apps
- designing the UI/UX
- creating the promo videos
- writing/arranging the musics
- everything else

A librarian app to store and collect various tunings for stringed instruments. It featured:

- a sine wave tone generator to generate the correct notes;
- a preview of the tuning played as plucked arpeggio or strumming arpeggiator;
- iCloud Drive support and exporting all tunings as CSV files for Excel;
- Pitch recognition;
- Reference tone generation;
- trasposition;
