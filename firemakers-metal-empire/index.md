# Fire Makers - Metal Empire


# Fire Makers – Metal Empire

In 2005, during a gap between travels and projects, I had the chance to collaborate as a guest keyboardist for an independent metal band named [Fire Makers](https://www.facebook.com/firemakersmetalband). They were in the process of recording their debut album *Metal Empire*, and I was invited to contribute organ, piano, and synthesizer parts on several tracks.

It turned out to be an electrifying and high-adrenaline experience. What struck me most was the stunning voice of their lead vocalist at the time—none other than [Eugent Bushpepa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugent_Bushpepa), who would later rise to prominence on international stages.

One of the most intense songs from that session is *Tears of Pain*, a dramatic and melodic track that fuses classic heavy metal riffs with progressive layers and soulful vocals. For this song, I played the Hammond-style organ parts using a **Roland VK-8**, while the piano and additional synth textures were layered on a **GEM S3 workstation**.

The combination of analog-style tonewheels and digital sample layering gave the track a punchy, symphonic metal atmosphere that still holds up remarkably well.

## 🎧 The Gear

- **Roland VK-8** – Drawbar organ emulator with Leslie simulation
- **GEM S3** – 76-key workstation for piano and synth textures

The band disbanded not long after the release, unfortunately. However, the spirit of Fire Makers lives on under a different name: **Maiden Division**, a tribute act dedicated to covering the music of Iron Maiden with great accuracy and passion.

## 🎸 Original Band Members

- **Vincenzo Armenise** — Bass  
- **Matteo Corelli** — Drums  
- **Massimo “Dingo” Candido** — Guitars  
- **Carlo Cicognani** — Guitars  
- **Fabio Guarnieri** — Vocals  

It was a joy and privilege to work with these musicians. I’d like to extend my sincere thanks to the whole band, and especially to **Max "Dingo" Candido** for involving me in such an energetic, albeit brief, collaboration.
