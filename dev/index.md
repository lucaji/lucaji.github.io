# About Lucaji


![](front-bg.jpg)

Hi, I am Luca, the milletgrain.

I take interests in software and hardware engineering and development, in addition to many other activities and skills I have gained in my etherogeneous careers and life.

{{< admonition type=success title="Fields of interest to pursue in the next future :(fa-solid fa-leaf):" >}}

- electronics applied to audio and music: amplifiers, filters, effects;
- standard and exotic musical tunings on acoustic and electric instruments;
- experiment, research and study of audio signals, interactions, psychoacoustics;
- Audio DSP, Max/MSP/Jitter, JUCE Framework, VST plug-ins;

**more concisely I am willing to invest my time in**

- perfectioning and expanding my actual knowledge :(fa-solid fa-seedling):
- learning by doing and/or benefit from a mentorship :(fa-solid fa-award):

After looking forward, we could read backwards in time; in the spoiler box below are some notes about my past and my present. After all I have more than 30 years of **professional workmanlike** background to offer.

{{< admonition type=info title="Me, Myself and I..." open=false >}}

- are very curious;
- observe patterns and spot connections;
- like software because it represent order and control;
- like audio and visual harmonies, aesthetical symmetries, and pleasant sounds;
- study piano and bass guitar;
- can play some other musical instruments like didjeridoo, flute and drums;
- really dig languages, ethymology, ancient remote cultures and folklore;

Since the early eighties I keep happily spending my time in front of monitors and keyboards and books and toolbenches.
I really like studying, being in quiet environments and I enjoy outdoors activities away from cities like mountain hiking and bicycling.
