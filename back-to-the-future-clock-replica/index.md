# DeLorean Time Circuits


This is a semi-serious rendition of the story behind the making of this project ‚Äî  
a **replica of the Time Circuits from *Back to the Future***, turned into a **talking alarm clock**.

Aside from actual time travel (which may or may not be possible depending on your time zone, ISP, and your ability to construct a [flux capacitor](https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Flux_capacitor)), it works beautifully as a nostalgic gadget, delivering iconic quotes from the film.

> If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.

[^1]: From *Back to the Future* (1985), directed by Robert Zemeckis. [Watch the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c).

## The Instigator

Every now and then, a certain **eclectic and gifted guitarist** crosses my path ‚Äî a lover of vintage gear, guitars, and cult memorabilia. On one such occasion, he approached from afar, waving cheerfully.

As he came closer, I noticed what he held in his hand:

- Not a beer glass (he doesn‚Äôt drink).
- Not a cigarette (he doesn‚Äôt smoke).
- It was... a tiny DeLorean model.

With a grin, he made his pitch:

- He wanted a *talking alarm clock* (because he oversleeps).  
- He wanted to *travel through time with it* (because history could use some edits).  
- He wanted to *play with it* (because all work and no play‚Ä¶ you know the rest).

So I said yes. I‚Äôd build a **working replica of the Time Circuits** ‚Äî minus the plutonium, of course.  
He promised to bring the flux capacitor.  
Spoiler: *he actually did.*

## Feature List (2014 prototype)

- Three LED display panels matching the film's color scheme and font
- Keyboard-based input for time configuration
- Iconic sound FX from the movie
- Alarm quotes voiced loudly through a speaker system


## Feature List (2024 prototype)

> After ten years, a complete rebuild has taken place. The project has been assembled as a **bare-metal** board, using ESP32 micro-controllers with WiFi support, separate I2S audio DAC and miniSD card reader for the webserver root and the audio files.

Updated information will come soon, stay tuned!

## 2014 Prototype Design

This was a **one-off build**, a passion project.  
No mass production, no scaling issues ‚Äî just pure, joyful making.

> That ain't working, that's the way to do it.

The mechanical fabrication was made possible with help from a good friend and his workshop full of vintage metalworking machines.

### Sizing & Display Selection

Sizing was based loosely on screenshots from the film‚Äôs DeLorean dashboard. The real prop likely varied across scenes, but the replica needed to look and feel believable.

Some nerdy notes:
- The **month indicator** in the film is a backlit plastic plate, not fitted with actual 16/14 segment LED display.
- I needed consistent **color availability** (red, green, amber), **segment types** (7 and 16-segment), and **character sizing**.

After long research, I chose **Sunbright 0.8-inch** LED displays.
This made the device chunkier than the film version ‚Äî but gave it a great stage presence.

The brains of the build? A **first-generation Raspberry Pi Model A** ‚Äî ideal for MP3 playback, speaker output, and NTP sync.

## Handcrafted Electronics

This prototype was **completely hand-soldered** ‚Äî a deliberate choice to avoid lengthy PCB design, fabrication, and routing time.

While a custom PCB would offer better repeatability, this approach let me skip double-layer trace headaches and work faster with **precise manual soldering**.

Using a manual router, I cut display slots in aluminum faceplates...

...then mounted the displays. Driver boards sit underneath ‚Äî the only PCBs actually designed for this project.

And finally ‚Äî the **7th of April, 2014**, permanently frozen in red, green, and yellow light.

## üé¨ Extras: TV Feature

Shortly after finishing the gadget, we were interviewed for Italian national TV (RAI3) as part of a segment called *Elogio della Creativit√†* (‚ÄúIn Praise of Creativity‚Äù).

Here‚Äôs a clip from that April 12, 2014 broadcast on TGR Abruzzo:
