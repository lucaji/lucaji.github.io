# 🎵 Goats, Tea and Trouble – Live Dance Visuals at Teatro Marrucino, Chieti 🌙


The song “Goats, Tea and Trouble” by @milletgrain draws from a vivid, whimsical tale of nomadic life, magic, and mischief under the moonlit skies of West Africa. This performance marks the first chapter of an unfolding trilogy rooted in coastal folklore and desert rhythms.

This excerpt was captured during MEDITERRANEO – I RACCONTI DELL’ACQUA, a special performance celebrating the 25th anniversary of Tiziano Di Muzio’s artistic journey with Centro di Formazione Professionale PROGETTO DANZA a.s.d. in Chieti.

The narrative is brought to life on stage through the elegant choreography of Bruna Cerasa, with the original Sora-generated visuals from Goats, Tea and Trouble projected behind the dancers at Teatro Marrucino on June 13, 2024.

# Videoclip Info

The video, generated scene by scene using AI, visually reimagines the story’s slow-burning magic and quiet absurdity. This piece lives somewhere between myth and memory—a tribute to all things untamed, unspoken, and strangely beautiful.

The song itself weaves together raw acoustic textures and sparse instrumentation, echoing the windblown silence of the coast and the quiet mischief of the night.

The shepherd may be imaginary—but the story, the sound, and the spell are real.
