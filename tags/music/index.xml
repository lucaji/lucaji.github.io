    <description><![CDATA[<p>Some stories arrive long before the music does. Goats, Tea and Trouble began as a slow-burning tale told under starlightâ€”a dreamlike fable set on Africaâ€™s western coast, where ancient spells, unruly goats, and firelit music blur the line between myth and memory.</p>
<p>This song is the echo of that story: a soundscape born from a nomadâ€™s bonfire, a missing cloth, and the quiet resistance of people who still live by rhythms older than time. Before you listen, read the story that inspired it.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>It was one of those summer mornings when time feels almost paused â€” a tranquil pocket of stillness nestled within the cityâ€™s otherwise relentless pulse. The grass was already warm with sun, and the air carried the scent of cut leaves and waking soil. Beneath the shade of a tall plane tree, a small group had gathered on mats, in silent reverence to breath and body. At the center stood a yoga teacher, her posture fluid, calm, unhurried â€” an embodiment of presence.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="kayaboard">KAYABOARD</h1>
<p>This is a Proof-Of-Concept of an <strong>organ keyboard</strong> using <strong>magnets</strong> instead of springs to obtain a nice upward release action and a decent downward counter-pressure when playing.</p>
<p>Designing a musical-instrument keyboard confronted me with some ergonomics considerations and material choices.
I did some research on magnets as well, to have a better understanding of their force irradiation and how to select them to save space, weight and achieve the best feeling when playing.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I designed these leaflets for a jam session night at <strong>Bar dello Sport, Serramonacesca</strong> using the images of <em>Tjalas</em>, the aboriginal name for this specimen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">honey pot ants</a> in central Australia, with their abdomen swollen with the sweetest <strong>honey</strong> you could ever think of.</p>
<p>We were staying in Serramonacesca, me and my old lady. Used often to spend there some holidays together. I got this invitation to a jam session night while drinking at the very place with the locals. I offered to draw the leaflet, got the ok, had more rounds till I went back home late that night to work on the poster.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This video is the official behind-the-scenes in LA while recording <strong>A Vision</strong> by Lorena Fontana, in the studios of Dennis Moody. I had the fortune to fully edit and assemble the video footage which gives a nice rendition of the atmosphere only professional musicians can breathe.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In between my travels I participated as guest keyboard player for a metal-band project while they were recording and releasing their album &ldquo;Metal Empire&rdquo;, the band name was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firemakersmetalband" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Fire Makers</a>.</p>
<p>I was very impressed by the lead singer, as it turned out he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugent_Bushpepa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Eugent Bushpepa</a>.</p>

    <title>The Leslie Speaker</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>This article explains the principles behind Leslie type loudspeakers and goes on to describe the construction of a generously proportioned system intended for use with a home constructed electronic organ. The article could provide the starting point from which individual readers could build up a rotating loudspeaker system to suit their own particular requirements.</p></blockquote>
<h1 id="rotating-system-loudspeakers-for-electronic-organs">Rotating System Loudspeakers for Electronic Organs</h1>
<p>The most obvious and the routine method of radiating sound from an electronic organ is by means of one or more loudspeakers, suitably and conventionally baffled. In a single-unit instrument, the loudspeaker(s) are mounted behind cutouts, usually in the front panel below the keyboard and above the pedal clavier.
While compact and convenient, this arrangement usually suffers some limitation in the effectiveness of the baffling which can be provided and the efficiency with which the sound can be propagated.</p>]]></description>
