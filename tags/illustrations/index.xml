    <description><![CDATA[I designed these leaflets for a jam session night at Bar dello Sport, Serramonacesca using the images of Tjalas, the aboriginal name for this specimen of honey pot ants in central Australia, with their abdomen swollen with the sweetest honey you could ever think of.
We were staying in Serramonacesca, me and my old lady. Used often to spend there some holidays together. I got this invitation to a jam session night while drinking at the very place with the locals.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In between my travels I participated as guest keyboard player for a metal-band project while they were recording and releasing their album &ldquo;Metal Empire&rdquo;, the band name was Fire Makers.
I was very impressed by the lead singer, as it turned out he was Eugent Bushpepa.
For this recording I played the organ parts on a Roland VK-8 and the piano/synths part on a GEM S3.
I sincerely wish to thank Max &ldquo;Dingo&rdquo; Candido for that brief but intense experience.]]></description>
