    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="proiezione-origami--book-cover-design">Proiezione Origami – Book Cover Design</h1>
<p>This cover design project began as a collaboration with the Italian author Alessandra Arcieri, who penned a cryptic and futuristic tale titled <em>Proiezione Origami</em>, set in a cyberzen world where consciousness, code, and combat blur into a single stream of unfolding events.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-the-narrative">Introduction to the Narrative</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rome, New York, Bombay. What will be the next target?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Set in a fragmented future, the narrative explores transcontinental power plays, high-stakes psycho-games, and mythic figures recast in digital landscapes. The protagonist, known as Agent Alpha, must decode a layered conspiracy crafted by a corporate demiurge. Her mission is embedded within verses from Walt Whitman’s <em>I Sing the Body Electric</em>—a haunting reference and anthem for the electrified self.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="crafting-the-leaflet-a-night-at-bar-dello-sport">Crafting the Leaflet: A Night at Bar dello Sport</h2>
<p>It all began with a casual evening at <strong>Bar dello Sport</strong> in Serramonacesca, sipping on the iconic Italian drink—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campari" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Campari Soda</a>—amid the warm embrace of local hospitality. Conversations drifted freely among friends and locals, and an idea sparked: designing a unique promotional poster for an upcoming jam session night sponsored by Campari. Fueled by inspiration (and a few rounds of drinks), I eagerly offered my skills as a graphic designer to craft the flyer.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="fire-makers--metal-empire">Fire Makers – Metal Empire</h1>
<p>In 2005, during a gap between travels and projects, I had the chance to collaborate as a guest keyboardist for an independent metal band named <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firemakersmetalband" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Fire Makers</a>. They were in the process of recording their debut album <em>Metal Empire</em>, and I was invited to contribute organ, piano, and synthesizer parts on several tracks.</p>
<p>It turned out to be an electrifying and high-adrenaline experience. What struck me most was the stunning voice of their lead vocalist at the time—none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugent_Bushpepa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Eugent Bushpepa</a>, who would later rise to prominence on international stages.</p>]]></description>
