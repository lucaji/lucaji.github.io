    <description><![CDATA[<p>I designed the cover for this enthralling <strong>cyberzen</strong> story, rich in obfuscated structures that only electricity can uncover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rome, New York, Bombay. What will be the next target? In a scenario รก-la Blade Runner, in a time marked by attacks and dominated by the logics of psycho-empowering games, every experience is transformed into Agone and every gamer in Ludopath. The jingle of the new role-playing game is a song by the TV musical &ldquo;Fame&rdquo;, inspired by the verses of Walt Whitman. Among these verses lies the secret of Agent Alpha&rsquo;s mission. The rebel player, determined to neutralize the mother-company and to discover the identity of the powerful demiurge, will have to deal with a fearsome opponent sent to flush her out, some mercenaries and a series of events created on-spot by the game. Among excellent university campuses, historic cities and metropolis with gray tones, all is played without the exclusion of blows. Alpha has a precious ally, a valid Master and a secret and very powerful energy resource, which she does not yet know. She will first have to sing the electric body. Finalist book at BUK Modena 2017.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I designed these leaflets for a jam session night at <strong>Bar dello Sport, Serramonacesca</strong> using the images of <em>Tjalas</em>, the aboriginal name for this specimen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">honey pot ants</a> in central Australia, with their abdomen swollen with the sweetest <strong>honey</strong> you could ever think of.</p>
<p>We were staying in Serramonacesca, me and my old lady. Used often to spend there some holidays together. I got this invitation to a jam session night while drinking at the very place with the locals. I offered to draw the leaflet, got the ok, had more rounds till I went back home late that night to work on the poster.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In between my travels I participated as guest keyboard player for a metal-band project while they were recording and releasing their album &ldquo;Metal Empire&rdquo;, the band name was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firemakersmetalband" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Fire Makers</a>.</p>
<p>I was very impressed by the lead singer, as it turned out he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugent_Bushpepa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Eugent Bushpepa</a>.</p>
