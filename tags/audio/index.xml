    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="geloso">GELOSO</h1>
<p>Geloso, founded in 1931 by Giovanni Geloso, was an Italian manufacturer of radios, televisions, amplifiers, amateur radio receivers, audio equipment and electronic components. Its headquarters were situated in Milan, Viale Brenta 29.</p>
<p>In 1931 the company started the production not only of radio sets but also most of the electronic components with which they were built and, over time, also developed and patented many others.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, Geloso expanded and expanded his production, becoming from 1950 onwards, a point of reference for enthusiasts of consumer electronics and hobbyists.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many many ways to build an amplifier, depending on money and time available, choosing the most expensive components, creating (or again, buy) a custom metal chassis (or have a friend that can make many as you want) with the objective to obtain a better build for the same price.</p>
<p>Building tube amps is very rewarding, and can keep you busy with its fair amount of metalwork and various power tools, like folding machines, press, lathe, milling machines and uncountable hand tools. Finishing the build with spray paint, adding lettering, logos, design elements one can go on forever. Custom shop!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="di-box">DI Box</h1>
<p>A handcrafted <strong>direct injection box</strong> ‚Äî a compact, AC-powered <strong>audio preamplifier</strong> designed for dynamic microphones, capable of cleanly converting mic-level signals to standard <strong>line-level output (-10dBV)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Class A <strong>FET input stage</strong> with high linearity and extended bandwidth</li>
<li>XLR input with adjustable gain</li>
<li>Balanced or unbalanced <strong>line-level output</strong></li>
<li>Low noise, low distortion performance</li>
<li>Wide frequency response</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-motivation--design-approach">üéôÔ∏è Motivation &amp; Design Approach</h2>
<p>While trying to record audio using a <strong>Shure SM58</strong> dynamic microphone directly into a Mac‚Äôs line-in jack, I encountered the usual issues: low gain, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and uninspiring tone. So, I decided to build my own solution ‚Äî a clean, simple <strong>preamplifier</strong> with tone characteristics I personally enjoy.</p>]]></description>
