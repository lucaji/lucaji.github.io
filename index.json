Some might even last for days or more. Having a software tool that can reliabily take care of storing the measured data and plot some nice graphs and even export the whole data-set is a great deal of help. Especially when such software can be customized to fulfill any kind of requirements. I have written this utility which interfaces with a hardware power measurement tool: the GPM8310 made by GW-Instek. It relies on an Telnet client which periodically queries the GPM to get the exact integrated values of power. GW-Instek Power Meter GPM8310 If you have a GPM8310 laying around, you can try-out this software utility called GPMLink whose source code is available at the link.

However, the white keys as they face the performer are still equal in width. As the space from C to E contains three white keys and five keys in total, while the space from F to B contains four white keys and seven keys in total, it is not quite possible to achieve this goal perfectly. If the internal spacing for the internals of a piano or organ is perfect, giving each of the twelve notes of the octave units of width on the keyboard, then the three white keys for C, D, and E would be 20 units wide, while the white keys for F, G, A, and B would be 21 units wide. If, on the other hand, the white keys present themselves with an absolutely equal width of 35 units each to the performer, then the five notes from C through E would be 21 units wide as they entered the instrument, and the seven notes from F through C would be 20 units wide as they entered the instrument. Since the internal mechanisms of a piano and organ could still have an exact equal spacing where they contacted the keys of the keyboard even if the latter alternative was chosen, that alternative, providing a better human interface, is likely to be the one used. In any case, what then are the nominal dimensions of a piano keyboard, ignoring the space between keys which will be required for them to move freely? While the keys on a typewriter keyboard are spaced on 3/4 inch intervals (19.05 millimetres), piano keys are somewhat larger, at least on a full-sized keyboard. One source, the book Electronic Musical Instruments by Richard H. Dorf, notes the dimension as being in the vicinity of 6.46 inches, with slight variations between manufacturers for a range from about 164 mm to 164.2 mm. 164 millimeters is about 6.4567 inches. 6 15/32\" is 6.46875 inches - and 207/32\". 6 29/64\" is 6.453125 inches - and 413/64\". Neither 164 nor 207 are numbers which are divisible by either 7 or 12, though, so there seems to be no obvious choice for the dimensions of a keyboard in the most commonly used units. However, the possibilities above overlook an important fact. It is desirable that the seven white keys be evenly spaced, and that their nominal dimensions be something that can be measured out in practice. It is also desirable that the twelve mechanisms inside the instrument be equally spaced, and that their positioning be measurable. But the equality of the width of the upper parts of the white keys can be allowed to vary a little, while keeping all the black keys as identical parts, with identical centering on their links to the internal mechanism would be highly desirable. Thus, the diagram showing a single keyboard design illustrates a more likely shape for the piano keyboard. It still, however, meets with the objection that the normal value for the width of an octave is not easy to divide into either 7 or 12 exactly using convenient units. However, given that high tolerances are used in manufacturing, precise units can be used. Thus, if we go with a fundamenal unit of 0.03845 inch, then the white keys are spaced on 0.9228 inch intervals, the internal mechanisms of the instrument are spaced on 0.5383 inch centers, and the width of an octave is 6.4596 inches. Or, if we go with a fundamental unit of 0.9762 millimetres, then the white keys can be spaced on 2.34288 cm intervals, the internal mechanisms of the instrument can be spaced on 1.36668 cm centers, and the width of an octave is 16.40016 centimeters. Thus, it is possible to design a piano keyboard without going insane. But perhaps only just. One would, of course, have expected that the standard width of a piano key would have been originally convenient in the system of measurement in general use. Thus, 3/4\" can be divided into 12 pa","date":"2020-07-02","objectID":"/kayaboard/:2:0","tags":["Hammond","Music","3D Modeling"],"title":"KAYABOARD - mag-lev organ keyboard (POC)","uri":"/kayaboard/"},{"categories":["Electronics"],"content":"Back to the '60s with a self-assembly amp kit!","date":"2016-10-30","objectID":"/geloso-tube-amp-open-air-cinema-restoration/","tags":["Audio","Tube Amps"],"title":"Restoration of an old open-air cinema PA","uri":"/geloso-tube-amp-open-air-cinema-restoration/"},{"categories":["Electronics"],"content":"GELOSO Geloso, founded in 1931 by Giovanni Geloso, was an Italian manufacturer of radios, televisions, amplifiers, amateur radio receivers, audio equipment and electronic components. Its headquarters were situated in Milan, Viale Brenta 29. In 1931 the company started the production not only of radio sets but also most of the electronic components with which they were built and, over time, also developed and patented many others. After the Second World War, Geloso expanded and expanded his production, becoming from 1950 onwards, a point of reference for enthusiasts of consumer electronics and hobbyists. The many products under the brand name Geloso were known throughout Italy and much appreciated abroad. The output consisted of innovative products known for their high quality, solid construction and reasonable price. The main production consisted of radios, amplifiers, tape recorders, televisions, kits, and professional laboratory instruments. These were complemented by components such as capacitors, resistors, potentiometers, switches, connectors, transformers and microphones. It is fashinating to know that this very amplifier was sold as a self-assembly kit and its build-date goes back to the mid ’70s. An exact date cannot be determined, but my friend gave this rough estimation.

It was not in good-shape as it has been left down in a storage room, with no much protection against humidity, dust and alike, all eroding agents for any electronic devices. Remarkably this is an assembled kit, made by this friends’ uncle back before the 70s. Back in its hey-days this very tube amplifier from GELOSO was used to amplify a cosy open-air cinema in warm summer nights in Italy between 1970 and late 1980. Believe it or not, audio quality was not an issue (it is not an Hi-Fi grade amp) but for spoken voice and those early sound effects present in films in the early ’80s, it was more than enough even for an open space. People were not even fussier about wanting a subwoofer or enjoy explosions like modern days: people just wanted to gather together and follow a nice story. So long for todays’ tastes… Anyway, here it is: it all its old and present glory, the GELOSO G-225/A. Amplificatore G-225/A Potenza modulata 25W - 6L6 push-pull class AB1 - 5 valvole - 2 prese mic e 2 prese pick-up con mixer - Guadagno 100.000 volte il segnale d’entrata Le due prese per microfono e le due per pick-up, i tre potenziometri di volume e due regolazioni di tono, il cambio delle tensioni e gli attacchi razionali di entrata e di uscita aggiunti alla possibilità di misclare i segnali dei diversi canali rendevano questo apparecchio adattabile alle più svariate installazioni: dagli ambienti chiusi di piccola capacità alle chiese ed ai cinematografi di capienza anche superiore alla media del periodo. I 25W di potenza utile effettivamente disponibili al secondario del trasformatori erano sufficienti per alimentare un numero considerevole di altoparlanti e permettere una razionale diffusione del suono. Tale caratteristica lo rendevano particolarmente adatto ad installazioni di capacità superiore alla media e nelle quali era richiesta una elevata (per l’epoca) fedeltà di riproduzione. In questo apparecchio l’amplificazione è di ben 100000 volte il segnale di entrata, mentre il noise floor era ridotto a circa 1/2500mo del segnale di uscita. A tali risultati si giunge usando opportuni accorgimenti nella progettazione dei circuiti di filtro e accendendo i filamenti delle due valvole 12SL7-GT con corrente continua ottenuta da un raddrizzatore a secco.

Alla griglia del primo triodo della seconda 12SL7 è applicato, attraverso un commutatore, l’ingresso pick-up. L’accoppiamento tra i due triodi della prima 12SL7 e la seconda è a resistenza-capacità con particolari accorgimenti per permettere la miscelazione dei due microfoni e di un pick-up e di regolare separatamente, a mezzo di tre potenziometri, il volume dei singoli canali. L’intermodulazione tra i due canali micro, con entrambi i microfoni inseriti, è trascurabile. Tra il primo ed il secondo triodo della seconda 12SL7 e tra questo e la 6J5 invertitrice di fase sono realizzati i circuiti del controllo di toni. I toni alti utilizzano un potenziometro logaritmico da 2MΩ, mentre al controllo dei bassi un doppio potenziometro: quello da 500kΩ logaritmico serve per eliminare il rialzo alle note basse dato dal condensatore da 10000pF in parallelo ad esso; l’altro da 500kΩ lineare ha il compito, variando la resistenza di griglia della 6J6, di diminuire la sensibilità dell’amplificatore alle note basse. Lo stadio finale è costituito da due 6L6 in configurazione push-pull. Il circuito di alimentazione è costituito da un trasformatore di alimentazione, da una 5X4 raddrizzatrice doppia onda e dai circuiti di filtro. Il condensatore di ingresso è da 32uF 500V e da esso vengono alimentate le placche dello stadio finale. Segue un partitore formato da due candele, una da 2000Ω 6W, ed una da 7500Ω 123W; in parallelo alla resistenza da 7500Ω 12W vi è un condensatore da 16uF 500V. Da questo punto del circuito vengono alimentati gli schermi dello stadio finale; segue una resistenza da 5000Ω ed un condensatore da 32uF 500V. Qui è collegata la resistenza di placca della 6J5 e della placca del secondo triodo della seconda 12SL7. Segue una resistenza da 7500Ω ed un condensatore da 16uF 350V. Da questo punto parte l’alimentazione delle placche del primo triodo della seconda 12SL7 e le placche della prima 12SL7. Un circuito raddrizzatore, con un raddrizzatore al selenio collegato a ponte, serve per l’accensione dei filamenti delle prime due valvole e per la polarizzazione negativa dello stadio finale. La capacità di ingresso del circuito di accensione è di 100uF 50V; dopo un impedenza di filtro Z309R c’è un altro condensatore da 300uF 25V. In questo punto è prelevata la tensione di polarizzazione per le griglie dello stadio finale. I filamenti delle due 12SL7 collegati in serie vengono pure collegati dopo l’impedenza. Il filamento della prima 12L7 è verso massa ed in parallelo a questo filamento vi è un altro condensatore da 300uF 25V. Le tensioni di lavoro dei condensatori elettrolitici e di quelli a carta, la potenza dissipata nelle resistenze chimiche ed in quelle a filo sono inferiori a quelle limite di funzionamento, in modo da offrire la massima garanzia di durata dell’impianto.

La misurazione di queste deve essere effettuata sia al primario del trasformatore di alimentazione, per verificare la tensione di rete, sia ai circuiti secondari e interni all’apparecchio. Per il controllo delle tensioni alternate potrà essere usato un qualsiasi voltmetro a ferro mobile o a raddrizzatore, purchè sufficientemente preciso. Per la misurazione delle correnti continue è invece necessario usare un voltmetro a bobina mobile a 20.000Ω per volt, poichè i valori della tabella che segue sono stati rilevati con uno strumento di tali caratteristiche. Qualora il tecnico disponesse di uno strumento di diverse caratteristiche, cioè di differente resistenza interna, si dovrà tener conto dell’eventuale caduta di tensione nelle resistenze del circuito al qualie si applica lo strumento, dovuta al maggior consumo di questo.

Building tube amps is very rewarding, and can keep you busy with its fair amount of metalwork and various power tools, like folding machines, press, lathe, milling machines and uncountable hand tools. Finishing the build with spray paint, adding lettering, logos, design elements one can go on forever. Custom shop! There are drawbacks though. The risks I experienced can be listed below. Danger getting an electric shock getting physically hurt the build time can be humongous and inversely proportional to the playing time the build time might keep extending due to improvements and continuous integration there can be failures Main advantages are: Success you will learn how to deal with high voltages you will learn how physical phenomena really works and how all those math formulas you saw at high school become alive you will learn how different materials can be glued and joined you will learn lots of tricks At the end of the day you can proudly showcase your rig and let somebody else play on it, until you clean up your workplace and get some sleep!

The tone can be always adjusted and the end of the chain, even in analog domain via an EQ, or in digital domain after sampling it with your favourite DAW and applying a digital EQ filter boosting or shelving frequencies at your liking. The dynamic response of this kind of pre-amp pleases my ear and the spectrogram when acquired. These are the main reason for this project to be. I avoided the USB port as power supply to avoid ground loops and noises from the computer (hisses), but being very practical, it might be a cool idea for a next revision. FET booster Both the triode version and the FET version works in a very similar way, by using a negative voltage controlled feedback to adjust their transconductance. Using 18V as power supply guarantees a very high dynamic range. A better and complete explanation is given by the Fetzer Valve Article, from which I took the initial inspiration and I ended up learning a bit more than when I started. Any JFET would do go, but I had a stash of 2SK30 and 2N5457 to choose from; I made some tests and ended up with the 2N5457 at the end. direct injection of a -20dBu 1kHz wave from a signal generation AC coupled, output volume maximum There was still some DC offset, which was due a defective trimmer for the bias voltage. using the Shure SM58 to capture a 1kHz wave at nearly full volume as played by a computer with its internal speakers The visible distortion in this last scope image is produced by a number of factors which won’t affect the scope of the project at all: The output of the 1kHz sine wave as captured by the Shure M58 at maximum gain.

Being built in the late 1920s, it was very heavy, bulky and used vacuum tubes and very archaic components to generate its two carriers for pitch and volume that were transferred to metal antennas. Probably the latter are the only same component stayed since the original prototypes: the antennas. It generates two carrier frequencies around 300kHz, slightly displaced each other to avoid cross-modulation and interference. By waving the hands in thin air just near the antennas, the oscillator frequencies are being altered, due to capacitive effects of the body. The internal circuitry then, derives a voltage proportional to the distance from each antennas which, in turn, drives a VCO and a VCA. These two acronyms, still existing today in modern synths stand for: Voltage Controlled Oscillator - able to change its generated frequency via a control voltage. Voltage Controlled Amplifier - able to change its gain via a control voltage. This consistent duality permits the executor to change pitch and amplitude indipendently, giving maximum expressiveness to the execution. The timbre, given by the VCO waveform directly by its shape, can be customized. But usually a sine-wave-like has always been used due to its “ethereal” appeal.

However, there is one electronic instrument that makes no apologies for its single, immediately recognizable sound: the theremin. This monophonic instrument has added its distinctive, melodic character to the scores of many horror and suspense movies and made its pop debut on the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations.” It has also appeared on many concert stages, including Carnegie Hall. The theremin was named after its inventor, Russian physicist and musician Leon Theremin, who developed the instrument in the 1920s. Unlike most musical instruments, the theremin is played with absolutely no physical contact. Players wave their hands in the air near two antennas. As one hand gets closer to the straight vertical tube (called the pitch antenna), the pitch rises; as the other hand gets closer to the horizontal tubular loop (called the volume antenna), the volume decreases. Because the theremin’s pitch and volume are intimately tied to the player’s hand motions, the tone has a vibrant, wavering quality, not unlike a human voice or a violin. Among the requests for DIY projects that EM receives, by far the most common is a do-it-yourself theremin. The instrument presented here is an authentic theremin, with antenna response characteristics, pitch range, and tone color that closely emulate Leon Theremin’s original designs. However, it is reasonably easy to build. It uses currently available components and materials that you can buy at your local hardware store or from mail-order electronic-parts distributors. If you know how to read a schematic diagram, solder, and use a voltmeter, and if you’re comfortable with basic home tools, you should be able to build and adjust this theremin. ","date":"2013-10-13","objectID":"/theremin/:3:1","tags":["Arduino","Music","Audio"],"title":"Theremin","uri":"/theremin/"},{"categories":["Hardware Builds","Software","Electronics"],"content":"OVERVIEW When you bring your hand near a theremin antenna, you are actually forming a variable capacitor: the antenna is one “plate” and your hand is the other. With the high frequencies and very low currents used by the instrument, your hand is effectively grounded by being attached to your body, so the antenna and your hand form a variable capacitor to ground. This variable capacitance is called hand capacitance. You increase the hand capacitance by bringing your hand nearer to the antenna. During normal operation, the hand capacitance is less than one picofarad, which is a very small capacitance indeed! Each antenna forms a resonant circuit with a group of inductors collectively called an antenna coil. In this design, the resonant frequencies are about 260 kHz for the pitch antenna and about 450 kHz for the volume antenna. At or near the resonant frequency, a tiny change in hand capacitance results in a larger change in the impedance of the antenna circuit as a whole. Refer to Figure 1, the functional block diagram and Figure 2, the schematic diagram of the entire circuit: The variable-pitch oscillator (VPO), fixed-pitch oscillator (FPO), and detector sections form a beat-frequency oscillator. Q1, Q2, and their associated components constitute the VPO, the frequency of which is set slightly higher than the resonant frequency of the pitch-antenna circuit (established by adjusting L5). As a player brings a hand near the pitch antenna, the changing impedance of the pitch antenna circuit lowers the VPO frequency by about 3 kHz. Q3, Q4, and their associated components form the FPO, the frequency of which is set equal to the VPO frequency (by adjusting L6) when the player’s hand is away from the pitch antenna. The difference, or beat, frequency is extracted by the detector and appears as an audio waveform at the junction of R23 and R24. As the player brings a hand near the pitch antenna, the frequency of the audio waveform goes from 0 to about 3 kHz (31⁄2 octaves above middle C). Q5 and its associated components constitute the pitch-tuning circuit. This circuit presents a variable active impedance that is used to make fine adjustments to the FPO frequency while the instrument is being played. Front panel potentiometer P1 adjusts the current through Q5, thereby changing its active impedance. Q6, Q7, and their associated components form the volume oscillator. Its frequency is set slightly higher than the resonant frequency of the volume-antenna circuit by adjusting L11. As the player brings a hand near the volume antenna, the resonant frequency of the volume-antenna circuit is lowered, and the DC voltage appearing at the junction of D1 and C12 is reduced. The resulting current flowing through R14 is amplified and level-shifted by the VCA processor section (U3-B and associated components) and then fed through R30 to control the gain of the voltage-controlled amplifier (U3-A and associated components). The amplitude-controlled audio output is then fed to front-panel jack J1. The maximum level is about 0 dBm (0.8V RMS). Q8 and its associated components constitute the volume-tuning circuit, which is nearly identical to the pitchtuning circuit. Potentiometer P2 is used to make fine adjustments to the volume-oscillator frequency during performance. The audio waveform is applied to pin 3 of U3-A at a level high enough to clip it. This has the effect of reshaping the waveform from a skewed sine to a quasi-rectangular wave, which is very similar to the waveform of Professor Theremin’s original instruments. P3 varies the input resistance of U3-A, which influences the amount by which the audio waveform is clipped. P4 shifts the bias at the input of U3-A, which changes the waveform width and therefore the output’s harmonic spectrum. C24 and C26 roll off the high-frequency harmonics to produce a pleasant, cello-like tonal balance.

They should be metallic, rugged, attractively finished, capable of being rigidly mounted, and easy to fabricate by a home hobbyist. I have found that 3/8-inch soft copper tubing of the sort that plumbers use with bathroom sinks works well. You can buy preplated, straight, short pieces at your local builders’ supply or hardware store. You can also purchase a simple tubing bender that will allow you to bend the volume antenna by hand without collapsing the tubing. You’ll also need a tubing cutter or hacksaw to cut the tubing to length. The finished pitch antenna is a straight, vertical tube eighteen inches long and 3/8 inch in diameter, and the finished volume antenna is a horizontal, hairpin loop with a total length of nine inches. The ends of the volume antenna should be separated by 31⁄4 inches, center to center. I suggest you make the antennas longer than necessary and then cut them to length after they’re formed and stiffened (discussed shortly). Start with a straight, 24- or 36-inch length of tubing for each antenna. To form the volume antenna, slip the tubing bender over the tube. Then, starting ,at the midpoint of the tube, bend it into a semicircular curve. Hold the tube in both hands and push into the curve with your thumbs while pulling down with your other fingers. Doublecheck to make sure that the two ends of the volume antenna are parallel and are the correct distance apart. Copper tubing has one drawback: because copper is soft enough to bend by hand, it is easy to put unwanted kinks in the tubing after it has been formed. You can stiffen the antennas by filling them with polyester resin (the liquid plus-hardener type used to repair car bodies) after you’ve formed them. This is not particularly difficult, but the potential for making a mess is significant, so be sure you have plenty of time and you’re at peace with the world. The pitch antenna is straight because this configuration is more sensitive to changing hand position when the hand is farther away and less sensitive when the hand is close. The change in hand capacitance is extremely small when the hand is far away, and the change in pitch as a function of distance must be as uniform as possible. The volume antenna is looped because this configuration is less sensitive when the hand is far away and more sensitive when the hand is close. This gives you greater control over the low end of the dynamic range and lets you articulate notes by quickly dipping your left hand into the loop (more in a moment) The two antennas are perpendicular to each other to minimize the interaction between them. For example, as you move your left hand tip and down above the volume antenna, its motion is parallel to the pitch antenna, which causes little or no change in pitch.

The antenna sockets are regular tube-to-pipe connectors that you can get when you buy the copper tubing for the antennas. The volume-antenna sockets are straight 3/8-inch-tube-to-3/8- inch-male-pipe connectors, whereas the pitch-antenna socket is a right-angle, 3/8-inch-tube-to-3/8-inch-male-pipe elbow. Drill 3/8-inch holes for these fittings; then screw them in by hand. If you can’t screw the 3/8-inch pipe threads into the wood by hand, don’t force it by using a pipe wrench: you may split the wood. Instead, enlarge the hole slightly with a large round file or a 3/8-inch pipe tap. Once you’re sure you can screw in the pipe fittings by hand, unscrew them, put a small amount of epoxy on the threads, and reinsert them by hand. Before the epoxy hardens, verify that the pitch-antenna socket is vertical by inserting the pitch antenna into the socket and adjusting the position of the socket as necessary. Two 4/4-inch X 3/4-inch blocks and one microphone-stand mounting flange are attached to the bottom of the enclosure. This lets you set the finished unit on a microphone stand (preferred) or on a wood (not metal) table when you play it.

It should be about nine inches long and should have bends at the top and bottom for mounting and stiffening. You can either cut and bend the panel yourself or have your local sheet-metal shop do it for you. Alternatively, you can buy a blank, single-space (1U) rack panel, which is 13⁄4 inches high by nineteen inches wide, cut it to length with a hacksaw, and attach the panel to the base from the front instead of from the bottom. However, that will leave a 1/4-inch gap between the top of the panel and the enclosure cover. Four rotary potentiometers, one 1/4-inch phone jack, one 1/8-inch mini-jack, and one toggle switch are mounted on the front panel. The two tuning pots should be located in the left part of the panel so your hand is as far from the pitch antenna as possible when You tune the antennas. Use high-quality, full-size rotary pots and large-diameter knobs for PI and P2, P3 and P4 are less critical; these pots can be miniature, and the knobs can be small. I suggest you use an insulated, 1/4-inch jack for J1 to avoid a ground loop between the audio and power grounds. Eight single-conductor wires and one shielded wire connect the front-panel components to the main circuit board, I suggest you use a connector for these wires so Von can unplug the panel if you need to work on the main circuit board.

A plug-in prototyping board of the sort used to assemble computer I/O circuits provides the space, connection provisions, and solidity you need. Radio Shack’s prototyping board (catalog #276-1598) provides ample space for all the circuitry with extra room to try your own modifications. The theremin’s power is supplied by a ±12 VAC wall wart, which is widely available (see sidebar “Where to Get Parts and Materials”). The AC voltage is converted into DC by two voltage regulators (UT, U2, and associated components). Keep the power-supply circuit components as close together as possible, and keep connections as short as you can. Be really sure that that C20 and C22 are very close to U2. The negative side of C19 and the positive side of C20 should be connected together with a very short lead, and the grounded side of J2 should also be connected to this lead. The voltage regulators are less likely to oscillate if the connections are kept as short as possible. Be sure to separate the VPO from the FPO by a couple of inches. These oscillators are already lightly coupled through C2 and C6, so they tend to synchronize at low beat frequencies (which is desirable). Placing the oscillator circuits close together increases the coupling, which may result in an excessive tendency to synchronize. In addition, place C4, C8, and C13 very close to the oscillator circuits with which they are associated to maximize the decoupling. After the main board is assembled and checked, brush the solder side with a small wire brush and inspect for unwanted solder bridges, wiring mistakes, and weak solder joints. Then set the board in the middle of the cabinet base in preparation for final test and tuning.

The inductors are not polarized per se, but each terminal is distinct: one emerges from the center of the coil and the other emerges from the outer layer of the coil. Arbitrarily select one terminal as the beginning and the other as the end, and connect the inductors in series so the end of one inductor is connected to the beginning of the next. Position the board on the base next to the pitch antenna. The free end of L4 should be close to the main circuit board, and the free end of Ll should be close to the pitch-antenna socket. Connect a short wire from the free end of LI to the pitch-antenna socket using a heavy soldering iron or by drilling and tapping a hole for a 4-40 thread and then mounting a solder lug.

Look for shorts, mistakes, missing connec- tions, etc. Then connect the front panel to the main board, plug in the power supply, and turn the power switch on. Use a voltmeter to check the voltages at the inputs and outputs of U1 and U2 (see Fig. 2). Then check the DC voltages at the collectors of Q1 through Q8 (they should all be about +12V); the emitters of Q1 through Q4, Q6, and Q7 (about 0.6V); and the emitters of Q5 and Q8 (about -2.6V). If you don’t observe all these readings, check everything until you find the problem. Next, verify that all three oscillators are working. Read the AC voltages across L5, L6, and L1 I. If you read about 10 VAC, then the corresponding oscillator is producing a waveform. If you don’t read any voltage at all, the oscillator is not working. To check the detector, measure the DC voltage across R24. If it’s -0.5V or so, the detector is working. Temporarily connect a pair of headphones or a small powered speaker across R24. Turn the tuning slugs in L5 and L6 counterclockwise until the tops of the slugs hit the shield cans. Be careful. Do not force the slugs farther than they want to go! Turn L5 exactly two turns clockwise. Then turn L6 clockwise slowly until you hear a high-pitched whistle. Keep turning until the tone is in the mid range (about I kHz). Now, turn P1 in either direction. You should hear the pitch change markedly. If you observe all these things, then the entire beat-frequency oscillator circuit is in good shape. To check the VCA, temporarily connect pin 12 of U3 to ground. (This should turn on the VCA.) Connect your headphones or monitor amp across R34. You should hear a somewhat louder tone. Now, disconnect the temporary ground connection to pin 12 of U3, and connect that pin to -12V. The audio across R34 should disappear. If it does, the VCA is working properly. While pin 12 of U3 is connected to ground, you can also check the Brightness and Waveform controls (P3 and P4). Use the Pitch Tuning control (PI) to set the tone’s pitch to approximately middle C. Then turn the Brightness and Waveform controls. The Brightness control should change the sound from muted to bright, and the Waveform control should change the sound from “reedy” (narrow waveform) to “full” (wider waveform). After you have checked all of these controls, remove the temporary connection to pin 12 of U3.

Leave a clear space of two or three feet around your work area. Place the cabinet base in the middle of the cleared space, put the pitch antenna in place, and connect the pitch-antenna circuit board between the antenna and the main board. On the main board, temporarily connect pin 12 of U3 to ground and connect the instrument’s audio output to headphones or a monitor amplifier. Now follow these steps to adjust L5 and L6: Set PI (the Pitch Tuning control) to its middle position. Grasp and hold the pitch antenna with one hand. With the other hand, adjust L6 until the beat frequency is zero, Then carefully turn L6 counter-clockwise until you hear a pitch of about 3 kHz (3 1⁄2 octaves above middle C). 3. Let go of the pitch antenna. Slowly retract your hand from the vicinity of the antenna. You should hear the pitch go down. If the pitch does not go down to zero when you’ve retracted your hand completely and stepped back, the inductance of L5 is set too high. Advance the slug in L5 clockwise by a small amount, perhaps 1/10 turn or so, and repeat steps 2 and 3. If the pitch goes to zero and then begins to ascend as you retract your hand, the inductance of L5 is set too low. Turn the slug in L5 counterclock-wise by a small amount, and repeat steps 2 and 3. If the pitch jumps abruptly as you retract your hand, the inductance of L5 is set far too low. Turn the slug in L5 counterclockwise approximately a quarter-turn and repeat steps 2 and 3. Eventually, you will converge on the proper settings for L5 and L6. The idea is to find the settings at which the frequency (a) is zero when you’ve stepped away from the theremin, (b) begins to ascend when your body is about two feet from the pitch antenna, and (c) reaches about 3 kHz when your hand touches the pitch antenna. Tap lightly on L5 and L6 as you converge on the proper settings, which will stabilize the tuning-slug positions. This completes the tuning of the pitch oscillators. In performance, the exact tuning is established by adjusting the pitch-tuning control (P1). Now, remove the temporary ground connection to pin 12 of U3. Connect a voltmeter from pin 12 of U3 to ground, install the volume antenna, and connect the volume-antenna circuit card between the antenna and the main board. Follow these steps to adjust L11: Set P2 to its mid position. Carefully turn the slug in L11 counterclockwise until it is out as far as it will go. The meter should read about -12V. Slowly turn the slug clockwise. At some point, you will see the voltage begin to rise from -12V. Stop when the voltage passes through 0 and becomes positive, At this point, bringing your hand near the volume antenna lowers the voltage; the meter should read about -12V when your hand is two or three inches from the volume antenna. This completes the tuning of the volume oscillator. In performance, the exact volume is established by adjusting the volume-tuning control (P2).

Place the instrument (with antennas installed) on a microphone stand that is set about 40 inches high. Connect a small monitor amplifier and speaker to J I and the 12 VAC wall-wart power adapter to J2. Turn on SW1 and touch the pitch antenna. Set P2 so the tone is loud when your left hand is well away from the volume antenna and the volume begins to decrease noticeably when your left hand is brought within ten to twelve inches of the volume antenna. Then set PI so the frequency is zero when your right hand is well away from the pitch antenna and the tone becomes apparent when you bring your right hand within 18 to 24 inches of the pitch antenna. Your instrument is now ready to play. As with any expressive musical instrument, playing the theremin takes some practice. You can start by follow-ing these simple exercises: Stand slightly left of the center of the instrument with your right shoulder about 24 inches from the pitch antenna. Relax your wrists. Think of a note and hum it to yourself. Then move your right hand toward the pitch antenna until the theremin pitch coincides with the pitch you’re humming. Now hold the note. This is not as easy as it sounds, but it’s an important technique to learn. At first, you will find it difficult to stand still, but a few hours of practice will work wonders. Hum two different notes, one after the other. Find the first note on the theremin, hold it, and then slowly glide to the second note. Repeat the above exercise, but bring your left hand near the volume antenna while your right hand glides from one note to the next. Move the left hand slowly at first and then more rapidly as you learn to move your left hand independently of your right hand. This exercise teaches you to “feel” where the notes are and to impart expressive dynamics. While playing a note, introduce vibrato by moving your right hand back and forth from your wrist several times a second. Concentrate on making the vibrato even and steady. These exercises address the basic skills of theremin playing: finding notes, playing intervals, articulating notes, and introducing vibrato. With these basic skills, you can play slow melodies. Practicing regular scales and arpeggios will increase your proficiency. Focus on accuracy of pitch and precise control of dynamics. Once you’ve mastered the basic moves, it’s time to develop your own style. Pay particular attention to shaping envelopes and dynamics with your left hand. The left hand can also be used to articulate discrete notes by momentarily dipping into the volume antenna as the right hand quickly moves from one pitch to another. Try combining audible glides and discrete pitch changes within a musical phrase. In addition, avoid constant vibrato in the right hand. Instead, impart expressive nuance by shaping the amount and rate of vibrato. These considerations are important components of theremin musicianship. The theremin presented here is designed to meet the needs of musicians who wish to explore the artistic resources of this unique instrument. Build your instrument carefully, and it will provide many years of reliable service. Practice with diligence, and you will provide enjoyable music for yourself and your audiences. Finally, be sure to give an occasional thought to the spirit of Leon Theremin, to whom we owe so much.

The article could provide the starting point from which individual readers could build up a rotating loudspeaker system to suit their own particular requirements. Rotating System Loudspeakers for Electronic Organs The most obvious and the routine method of radiating sound from an electronic organ is by means of one or more loudspeakers, suitably and conventionally baffled. In a single-unit instrument, the loudspeaker(s) are mounted behind cutouts, usually in the front panel below the keyboard and above the pedal clavier. While compact and convenient, this arrangement usually suffers some limitation in the effectiveness of the baffling which can be provided and the efficiency with which the sound can be propagated. A logical “next step” in improving the performance of an electronic organ is to associate with it a generously designed remote loudspeaker system, which can provide good fundamental bass output and which can propagate the sound from a position in the building where it will be heard to advantage, and enrich itself with natural re-verberation. Where the basic organ makes available its different voices from two or more channels, additional remote loudspeakers may be used, with or without supplementary amplifiers, dispersion of sound sources, more akin to what occurs naturally with pipe instrument. Despite such measures, a charge levelled against electronic organs is that, while large amplifiers and elaborate loudspeakers can make them loud, the basic tone structure is too simple and too rigid, particularly where the generator system employs sequence of frequency-locked dividers. “interest” which is present when the sound is being built up from a large number dispersed and independant pipes, which are nominally in tune but not phase locked The problem has been countered in clectronic organs by the use of separate oscillators in a limited number of designs, by the free use of variable-speed variable-depth vibrato and/or tremolo, and by the use of synthesised echo (reverberation). With such resources, good design and good playing technique, electronic organs can produce music which is appealing enough to have ensured their very wide acceptance in home, entertainment, and church situations. However, over and above these largely electronics measures to add variety and interest to electronic organ sound, there has been wide adoption of the principle of feeding art of the sound to a loudspeaker system whose sound dispersion pattern is costantly being changed by actual physical rotation of the sound source. One such system, which received a lot of early publicity, was the “Gyro” loudspeaker marketed by the Allen Organ Company. Externally, a typical Gyro cabinet appeared to be a fairly conventional open-backed unit, with loudspeakers radiating through a front fret. Behind the fret, however, a large circular flat baffle was arranged to spin on a stout supporting spindle. Mounted on the baffle, 180 degrees apart and carefully balanced were (or are) two 8-inch loudspeakers, receiving drive from the amplifier through a pair of slip rings. A motor inside the cabinet drives the spindle through suitably proportioned pulleys so that the loudspeakers can be spun as they radiate the organ sound. In spinning they introduce “Doppler” effects which cause the sound as heard to be periodically raised and lowered in pitch as the cones alternatively and periodically vary the respective distances to the listeners’ ears. The same effect modulates the intensity and frequency of all natural echoes in the building so that the unit adds markedly to the complexity and potential aural interest of the radiated sound. If such a loudspeaker system is used in addition to, but remote from a conventional fixed system, the rotating unit can provide the effec","date":"2006-07-02","objectID":"/leslie-speaker/:0:0","tags":["Hammond","Music"],"title":"The Leslie Speaker","uri":"/leslie-speaker/"},{"categories":["Media"],"content":"Foreword This is a transcription of my Diploma thesis simply titled “Visual Communication” written in June 2000. The topic is woven around Visual Communication, an emerging trend in computer science in those years. Personal computers were just beginning to gain more computing power, little by little, slowly approaching that of mainframes of the era. Digital Signal Processing was out-of-the-question for a little home computer. But the direction was set, and soon enough, some decades later we can do the unthinkable on our notebooks now. I was getting my Diploma, and I was all excited about video signals, sampling techniques and image compression algorithms. I made a video digitizer card, using a PIC microcontroller and some other discrete ICs to extract the video composite timings, drive an ADC to a memory buffer and transfer a single picture frame over serial port to a PC. Little could be found on USENET as I did not have a reliable Internet provider. Bullettin Board Systems were becoming obsolete and access to Compuserve or AOL was migrating over to modernizing universities and first data centers. Long story short, I had only a bunch of printed out datasheets and some old paper to do my research. It ended up well, the prototype was build and worked well. Sadly I do not possess any photographs, shot with a film camera which has since disappeared nor the hardware itself, lost in the school’s archive, ended up in a landfill.

In this case, however, I prefer to start by trying to motivate my choice to want to talk about visual communication by illustrating its inspiring motif by seeking help in the discipline of Philosophy, the only one, by definition, able to reach the primary principles and origins altogether. In fact, the human need to know, to know, to find out is, for Plato and Aristotle, the wonder that a human being feels before something new, theory later taken up by Freud in childhood psychoanalysis, that in the adult state of the person evolves into an incessant mental work of seeking Truth and a need of man to communicate, fueling the importance of the concept of information. In un tempo di conquiste come il nostro, l’uomo si è reso conto che il solo fatto di detenere la maggior quantità di informazioni può renderlo potente e se egli può disporne in modo tale da diffonderla nei modi e nelle quantità e negli aspetti a lui congeniali, di conseguenza può giungere direttamente nelle case delle persone arrivando fino a manipolarne i gusti e le scelte. Il media che attualmente dispone di questi requisiti è la Televisione, più che un elettrodomestico, meno della Verità.

Tutto ciò giocando sulla cognizione di causa che essa sfrutta, a differenza di altri media, due sensi percettivi contemporaneamente: l’udito e la vista aumentando la possibilità di cogliere l’attenzione di un osservatore. Questa sua importanza nell’ambito socio-culturale mi ha portato alla scelta della comunicazione visiva come oggetto di questa tesi che non può essere una denuncia degli usi e abusi che se ne fanno, ma è un riconoscimento del peso che essa ha su di noi.

Scoperta la possibilità di produrre, dirigere e sfruttare un flusso di elettroni, si prospettarono immediatamente numerose applicazioni. Una delle scoperte decisive fu quella dell’effetto fotoelettrico, mediante il quale si poteva convertire la luce in elettricità. Il principio della televisione in fondo è di una semplicità assoluta: trasmettere nello spazio una figura complessa può apparire piuttosto difficile, ma trasmettere un segnale elettrico è una cosa molto semplice; se si scompone dunque una immagine in una serie di piccoli punti e si trasmette ogni punto sotto forma di impulso elettrico, non resterà che ideare un apparecchio ricevente che ritraduca questi impulsi nell’ordine voluto, per avere l’immagine trasmessa in partenza. Trasformare questi punti in correnti più o meno intense, trasmetterle nello spazio e far sì che il ricevitore li riordini in sincronismo perfetto con il trasmettitore, questo era il problema che si trovarono a risolvere i pionieri della televisione. In fondo l’idea era di carpire la figura umana e di trasportarla oltre le barriere dello spazio, di vedere immagini in azione, persone e fatti nel momento stesso in cui avvengono a molti chilometri di distanza, aveva interessato più la magia che la scienza. E forse, anche quando la situazione tecnica poteva incoraggiare l’impresa, occorreva pur sempre un po’ di follia e di disperazione per lanciarsi nell’avventura. Qualità che non mancarono ad una curiosa figura di scozzese, John Logie Baird, inventore ed affarista sfortunato, che inseguì a lungo le idee più paradossali e si dedicò ad operazioni finanziarie più contorte prima di dedicarsi, senza alcuna visibile speranza di successo, al problema della televisione. Dopo essersi occupato per qualche tempo dell’effetto fotoelettrico (era riuscito ad azionare, verso gli inizi della prima guerra mondiale, un campanello avvalendosi della luce solare), Baird si dedicò per qualche tempo ad attività svariate: ideò e mise in commercio delle solette di carta per tenere caldi i piedi, inventò un lucido da scarpe, brevetto un rasoio di vetro dagli effetti disastrosi ed un calzino pneumatico per individui affetti da piattismo: l’esplosione dei suoi calzini nei momenti meno prevedibili fece naufragare anche quest’ultima impresa e lo spinse a riprendere i suoi esperimenti in elettronica. Egli riuscì a trasmettere, con apparecchiature assolutamente improvvisate (la lampada di proiezione era fatta con una scatola da biscotti con lenti dozzinali e utilizzò un lavabo come base), l’immagine di una croce di Malta. Quindi proseguì gli esperimenti finanziato da una fabbrica di apparecchi elettrici, che lo indusse, per ragioni pubblicitarie, ad esibirsi davanti ai frequentatori di un emporio; ma le immagini trasmesse erano confuse, poco più che ombre, ed il pubblico accolse con diffidenza ed ironia l’invenzione. Egli continuò gli esperimenti finché, nel 1926, poté mostrare un esperimento piuttosto soddisfacente sulla figura umana, ad una commissione scientifica. Nel 1929 la BBC iniziava una serie di trasmissioni televisive sperimentali. Non più una aspirazione magica, non più un progetto di un esaltato ma la televisione entrava nella fase di attuazione. Posti i principi basilari, la trasmissione televisiva era diventata un problema di ricerca industriale la cui soluzione progressiva continua tuttora, quando ormai il nuovo mezzo si è imposto come uno dei fenomeni tipici della nostra epoca. Occorre tuttavia notare che tra i primi esperimenti ed il boom televisivo vero e proprio siano trascorsi parecchi anni, più di quanti la logica stessa degli esperimenti richiedesse; ma il secondo conflitto mondiale agì da freno su queste ricerche: la televisione era ancora un gioco di lusso e non se ne potevano intravedere le enormi possibilità di direzione de","date":"2000-06-10","objectID":"/video-acquisition/:2:0","tags":["Diploma"],"title":"Visual Communication and Video Acquisition","uri":"/video-acquisition/"},{"categories":["Media"],"content":"Scheda di Digitalizzazione Video Il progetto portato insieme a questo documento, è un circuito capace di digitalizzare un segnale video proveniente da una telecamera, un videoregistratore o un televisore (o qualsiasi altra fonte video composita analogica) potendo successivamente visionare l’immagine catturata sullo schermo di un comune Personal Computer, con tutti i vantaggi che derivano dalla forma digitale nella quale viene convertito il segnale video con la possibilità di salvare il fotogramma su disco fisso, riaprirlo in un secondo tempo, inviarlo ad altri utenti di una rete, stamparlo, ecc.

Fig. 1. Per evitare lo sfarfallío, ogni immagine viene riprodotta sullo schermo di un TV con due quadri alternativamente: uno composto da sole righe pari ed uno da sole righe dispari. Interlacciando questi due quadri, il nostro occhio per effetto delia persistenza ottica caratteristica della retina vedrà un'immagine completa. Pertanto, il primo semiquadro risulterà formato da 312, 5 linee dispari, cioè le righe 1-3-5, ecc., ed il secondo da altre 312,5 linee pari, le 2-4-6-8, ecc. Poiché la velocità con cui questi semiquadri appaiono sullo schermo è superiore alla velocità di risposta dell’occhio umano, quest’ultimo non risente di queste interruzioni dovute all’alternanza delle righe dell’immagine. La durata dì una riga singola (sia essa pari o dispari) è di 64 µS ed inizia con un impulso negativo della durata di 5 µS, detto impulso di sincronismo atto ad identificare l’inizio di una riga. Finito l’impulso di sincronismo, inizia il burst colore che, ovviamente sarà assente se l’immagine è in bianco e nero. Dopo circa 12 µS dall’inizio dell’impulso di sincronismo, inizierà il segnale della riga dell’immagine che avrà una durata di 51 µS. L’informazione della riga dell’immagine è modulata in ampiezza: ad un livello di tensione del 7,5% (sul massimo valore picco/picco del segnale video applicato all’ingresso) corrisponde il colore nero, mentre alla massima ampiezza di segnale, corrisponde il bianco e qualsiasi altro livello intermedio tra il 7,5% ed il 100% corrisponde ad una diversa tonalità di grigio. Fig. 2. Ogni riga di quadro dura 64µS, iniziando con un sync negativo della durata di 5µS, seguito da un burst per il colore. Dopo 12µS inizia il segnale delle immagini che dura 51 µS. Ad una ampiezza del 7,5% equivale un tratto nero, al 50% un grigio e al 100% bianco (massima luminosità). Questo per tutte le righe che compongono l’immagine (625). Ogni ultima riga di ognuno dei due semiquadri, presenta un intervallo di blanking, che identifica la transizione tra i due; in particolare l’ultimo semiquadro presenta un’ultima riga più corta, per dare spazio al cosiddetto vertical blanking interval, composto di tre parti: gli impulsi di equalizzazione, gli impulsi verticali fitti e di nuovo degli impulsi di equalizzazione, dopodiché segue uno spazio senza immagine (11 righe) contenente esclusivamente gli impulsi di sincronismo video al cui interno è possibile inserire le informazioni televideo.

Un filtro è caratterizzato da alcuni parametri fondamentali: innanzitutto il tipo (descritti in seguito dettagliatamente) poi l’ordine, la frequenza di taglio, la banda passante e, infine, la realizzazione circuitale dei filtri che può avvenire sia mediante componenti esclusivamente passivi, ovvero R, L, C, sia tramite l’aggiunta di dispositivi attivi quali transistor e amplificatori operazionali. Passa Basso (LPF) Il filtro bassa basso non altera apprezzabilmente i segnali che hanno frequenza inferiore a quella di taglio e attenua i restanti. Passa Alto (HPF) Il filtro passa alto non altera apprezzabilmente i segnali che hanno frequenza superiore a quella di taglio e attenua i restanti. Passa Banda (BPF) Il filtro passa banda non altera apprezzabilmente i segnali che hanno frequenza compresa tra le due di taglio e attenua i restanti. Elimina Banda (BSF) Il filtro elimina banda non attenua i segnali che hanno frequenza compresa tra le due di taglio e non altera apprezzabilmente i restanti. Fig. 3. Specifiche di trasmissione dei principali tipi di filtro. Molteplici settori dell’elettronica, quali ad esempio l’audio Hi-fi, la telefonia e la strumentazione di misura, necessitano di sistemi in grado di discriminare, secondo specifiche assegnate, le diverse componenti spettrali del segnale d’ingresso. I filtri passivi assolvono tale compito, ma comportano problemi di caricamento degli stadi ad essi accoppiati; le realizzazioni attive superano questo problema mediante l’impiego di amplificatori operazionali e consentono di ottenere f.d.t. caratterizzate da poli complessi coniugati senza ricorrere all’uso di bobine che, rispetto ai condensatori, presentano maggiori deviazioni dal comportamento ideale dovute alla resistenza dell’avvolgimento. Le realizzazioni attive trovano uso estensivo nei sistemi che operano a frequenze inferiori a qualche centinaio di KHz, mentre quelle passive vengono impiegate in reti che elaborano segnali anche a frequenze dell’ordine di centinaia di MHz. Tali filtri, possono essere definiti mediante le specifiche di trasmissione illustrate in Fig. 3; queste individuano una zona del diagramma della risposta entro la quale deve essere compreso l’andamento di |F(jw)|, al fine di ottenere la caratterizzazione voluta. Per offrire generalità alla rappresentazione il valore massimo del modulo è normalizzato a 0 dB: in altri termini, viene trascurata un’eventuale traslazione verticale rigida dell’intero grafico dovuta all’esistenza di una costante moltiplicativa nella f.d.t. Ogni filtro presenta una banda passante (passband) in cui il modulo permane inalterato entro una fascia di tolleranza F1 e una banda oscura (stopband) in cui il modulo assume valori inferiori a F2 oppure a F3; l’intervallo che separa le precedenti definisce invece la banda di transizione. In tabella 1 sono indicate le pulsazioni che delimitano ciascuna banda. È importante sottolineare che la larghezza della banda di transizione, associata alla differenza (F2 - F1) oppure (F3 - F1), qualifica la discriminazione in frequenza operata dal filtro; ciò si riflette sull’ordine della f.d.t. e quindi sulla complessità della struttura circuitale.

I segnali sono contraddistinti da molteplici parametri, quali l’ampiezza, la frequenza, la fase, il duty-cycle e la polarità; l’informazione viene quindi rappre-sentata in termini analitici da una funzione y = f(t) che esprime il legame tra un parametro y prestabilito ed il tempo. E’ inoltre importante distinguere fra rappresentazione di tipo analogico e di tipo numerico; in un intervallo prefissato della variabile y il segnale analogico può assumere idealmente infiniti valori significativi, mentre il segnale numerico può assumere solo un numero finito. In particolare il dominio e il codominio sono continui nel primo e discreti nel secondo. Un importante caso di segnale numerico è quello di tipo binario, nel quale sono significativi solo due valori, denominati livelli logici. Nei sistemi digitali, l’informazione è associata ad un codice costituito da un insieme di due simboli, quali 0 ed 1, utilizzati per rappresentare una serie di numeri in base ad una prefissata convenzione; ad esempio nel codice binario naturale 4 bit consentono di individuare 16 distinte combinazioni associabili ad altrettanti numeri, lettere o qualsivoglia notazione. L’unità elementare di un messaggio è quindi composta da una ripetizione di simboli denominata parola; la sua lunghezza risulta funzione del numero di distinte combinazioni richieste. Il raggruppamento dei simboli che costituisce una parola può essere presentato in modo contemporaneo (forma parallela) o sequenziale (forma seriale). Al fine di porre in luce le peculiarità dei segnali analogici e di quelli digitali, si espongono a seguito alcune considerazioni: Poiché il segnale analogico evolve con continuità è possibile in linea teorica individuare infiniti livelli; tuttavia il rumore sempre presente nei sistemi elettronici non rende distinguibili due valori che distano tra loro di una quantità inferiore all’ampiezza del disturbo. Quest’ultimo comporta quindi un deterioramento dell’informazione e al limite la totale mascheratura dei segnali più deboli. La qualità di un segnale analogico è perciò descritta dal rapporto segnale-rumore. Il rumore sovrapposto a un segnale digitale non compromette invece il contenuto informativo purché, a causa della sua ampiezza istantanea, non sia interessata la zona di indeterminazione; infatti ciascun livello logico ammette una fascia di valori entro la quale l’informazione è riconosciuta univocamente come stato 0 (basso) o 1 (alto). Da quanto esposto nel punto precedente emerge che l’elaborazione e la trasmissione di segnali digitali risulta apparentemente meno problematica. Occorre tuttavia considerare che tali operazioni condotte su una parola in forma seriale richiedono un tempo proporzionale alla lunghezza della parola stessa; invece nel caso in cui quest’ultima presenti una forma parallela le operazioni sono più rapide ma il transito dell’informazione necessita di un maggior numero di linee, rendendo in tal modo più complessa la struttura dell’hardware. Contrariamente il segnale analogico è sempre elaborato e trasmesso in tempo reale, ovvero senza ritardi apprezzabili, e richiede un’unica linea di comunicazione. I sistemi digitali sono caratterizzati da un’elevata versatilità in quanto, con l’avvento dei microprocessori, le funzioni svolte dai circuiti logici risultano definite da un programma facilmente modificabile; ciò è reso possibile dalla semplicità di memorizzare una notevole quantità di dati senza perdita alcuna di precisione. La flessibilità delle strutture programmabili consente di specializzare in modo diverso il trattamento dell’informazione, senza alterare sostanzialmente l’architettura del sistema.

In tale documento si parlerà principalmente di quella A/D, utilizzata dal circuito realizzato. La conversione D/A è in effetti realizzata direttamente dal monitor del computer che converte l’immagine digitalizzata nuovamente in forma visibile. In figura 4 è riportata l’architettura di un complesso per il trattamento digitale dell’informazione analogica; i blocchi in essa evidenziati svolgono le funzioni esposte a seguito. Il circuito campionatore (sampling circuit) provvede a generare una sequenza di impulsi vs(t) di durata teoricamente infinitesima e di ampiezza pari a quella assunta dal segnale d’ingresso vi(t) negli istanti di campionamento; viene in tal modo operato un passaggio da una rappresentazione in un dominio continuo ad una in un dominio discreto. La memoria analogica (holding circuit) riproduce in uscita un livello di tensione vsh(t) eguale a quello campionato e lo mantiene costante sino al successivo impulso; questo blocco è necessario per presentare al convertitore A/D un valore inalterato durante l’intervallo di tempo richiesto per la conversione. Se il segnale possiede un andamento lentamente variabile lungo l’intervallo suddetto, lo stato campionatore e la memoria analogica possono essere omessi. Il convertitore A/D codifica l’ampiezza di vsh(t) in una parola digitale contraddistinta da un prefissato numero n di bit. La grandezza all’ingresso di tale circuito possiede un codominio continuo, cioè può evolvere nel tempo assumendo un numero infinito di valori; l’informazione all’uscita è invece di tipo discreto, ovvero è rappresentata da un numero finito di valori. Da ciò si deduce che il convertitore A/D opera una quantizzazione del segnale campionato, suddividendo idealmente l’intervallo delle tensioni d’ingresso in un numero l di livelli che, nel caso di codifica binaria risulta pari a l = 2^n Il sistema digitale rappresenta, nello schema a blocchi proposto, un qualsiasi trattamento numerico dell’informazione, quale ad esempio l’elaborazione o il processo di trasmissione-ricezione dei segnali. Il convertitore D/A decodifica la parola digitale fornita dal blocco precedente e restituisce un segnale quantizzato vq(t) con dominio e codominio entrambi discreti; la forma d’onda assume quindi un andamento a gradinata. Il filtro di ricostruzione sopprime le componenti armoniche di vq(t) estranee allo spettro associato all’informazione, producendo in uscita un segnale v0(t) analogico, ossia dotato di dominio e codominio continui.

Il controllo può richiedere l’azione di un operatore che deve regolare manual-mente opportuni attuatori, oppure può avvenire in modo automatico subordinando il pilotaggio di questi ultimi direttamente all’apparato di raccolta dati. Allo stato attuale la gestione degli impianti industriali è delegata quasi esclusivamente a macchine elettroniche in virtù dell’accuratezza, della velocità, dell’affidabilità e dei bassi costi di gestione propri di tali sistemi. Inoltre lo stato dell’arte delle logiche programmabili e dei personal computer consente di realizzare controllori di processo caratterizzati da un’elevata flessibilità; in altri termini è possibile cambiare il ciclo produttivo semplicemente apportando delle modifiche al programma implementato sul computer. Fig. 5. Schema generale di una catena di acquisizione. Ogniqualvolta occorra descrivere sotto il profilo scientifico un sistema in regime statico o in evoluzione temporale è necessario operare un rilievo delle grandezze fisiche che lo caratterizzano; ciò offre l’opportunità all’osservatore di intervenire successivamente sul sistema stesso al fine di modificarne il comportamento. L’esecuzione della misura può avvenire mediante tecniche elettroniche che, rispetto a tecniche di natura diversa, consentono di raggiungere sensibilità, precisioni e rapidità di risposta considerevoli; esse inoltre rendono possibile l’elaborazione, la memorizzazione e la trasmissione dei dati acquisiti. Nella figura 5 è illustrata la configurazione generale di una catena di misura in grado di visualizzare, su uno o più organi di presentazione dati, il valore di una grandezza fisica rilevata da un sensore remoto. La descrizione di ogni singolo blocco che compone tale schema è riportata nei punti seguenti: Il sensore posto all’ingresso della catena provvede alla trasformazione della grandezza da misurare in una corrispondente variabile elettrica; si rammenta che la natura dei segnali prodotti è prevalentemente analogica, tranne in alcuni casi nei quali il sensore stesso opera una codifica digitale dell’informazione, come ad esempio nell’encoder. Il segnale generato dal sensore necessita di norma di un primo condizionamento sull’ampiezza operato da un preamplificatore lineare a basso rumore; ciò eleva l’immunità ai disturbi che si sovrappongono all’informazione in transito lungo i successivi blocchi. Nel caso in cui la variabile di uscita del trasduttore sia una corrente è talvolta necessario che questo stadio effettui anche una conversione corrente-tensione (1/ V): allo scopo viene impiegato un amplificatore di transresistenza. Qualora al segnale sia associata una componente di modo comune, come ad esempio si verifica all’uscita di un ponte di misura, è opportuno adottare un amplificatore per strumentazione qualificato da un elevato valore di CMRR. Si ricorda che una tensione di modo comune può insorgere anche per interfe-renze elettromagnetiche indotte sul cavetto che collega il sensore al blocco di preamplificazione; questi disturbi, particolarmente deleteri per segnai a basso livello, sono comunque minimizzati impiegando un cavetto schermato. In talune circostanze il sensore è collocato in una posizione remota rispetto al sistema di elaborazione e presentazione dati, ovvero rispetto all’ambiente dove agisce l’operatore (control room); in tal caso si rende necessario introdurre nella catena un trasmettitore ed un corrispondente ricevitore. La linea lungo la quale transitano le informazioni può essere costituita da un cavo elettrico, da una fibra ottica o in casi particolari dall’etere.

Un messaggio in forma digitale può essere presentato a una linea di trasmis-sione sia con un assetto parallelo, sia con un assetto seriale. Nella forma parallela tutti gli n bit di ogni singola parola vengono trasmessi simultaneamente ed è quindi necessario l’impiego di n fili oltre a quello di massa; ne consegue un elevato costo del mezzo trasmissivo che limita l’utilizzo di questa tecnica a comunicazioni di breve distanza, quale ad esempio l’allacciamento di un plotter a un personal computer. Inoltre l’accoppiamento induttivo e capacitivo fra i diversi conduttori, disposti in genere in un unico cavo, produce interferenze (cross-talk) di ampiezza rilevante qualora più bit presentino simultaneamente il medesimo cambiamento di stato. Nella forma seriale tutti gli n bit di ogni singola parola vengono trasmessi in modo sequenziale, cadenzati da impulsi di clock, ed è quindi sufficiente l’impiego di un solo filo oltre a quello di massa; ne consegue una drastica riduzione dei costi, particolarmente sensibile su lunghe tratte, e un miglioramento dell’affidabilità dell’intero sistema. Si rende tuttavia necessario l’utilizzo di registri per la conversione parallelo-serie (PISO) in sede di trasmissione e di registri serie-parallelo (SIPO) in ricezione; infatti i circuiti digitali di elaborazione manipolano in genere parole in formato parallelo che transitano sul bus dati. Il maggior inconveniente di questa tecnica risiede nella lentezza intrinseca del trasferimento dei dati, poiché la trasmissione di ogni singola parola richiede al minimo n impulsi di clock. Malgrado ciò l’assetto serie ha trovato una notevole diffusione in quanto si adatta ai canali di comunicazione già esistenti, quali le linee telefoniche. Si precìsa che con il termine velocità di trasmissione si intende, per il formato seriale, il numero di bit trasferiti in un secondo; l’unità adottata è quindi il bit/s oppure, nel sistema binario, baud. Per il formato parallelo si adotta invece l’unita cps, acronimo di caratteri per secondo. Affinché sia possibile decodificare un messaggio in forma seriale occorre che esso contenga dei segnali di riferimento utili per la sincronizzazione del ricevitore con il trasmettitore; a seconda della tecnica utilizzata si distinguono i due tipi di comunicazione seriale riportati in seguito. Nella trasmissione asincrona il segnale di sincronismo è inviato all’inizio (bit di start) e alla fine (bit di stop) di ogni parola. Di norma, in assenza di trasmissione, la linea è posta a livello alto; il primo fronte di discesa corrisponde quindi al bit di start che attiva un clock locale con frequenza idealmente identica a quella del trasmettitore. Fanno seguito gli n bit della parola che costituisce l’informazione, un fronte di salita corrispondente al bit di stop ed infine un livello alto che permane sino al sopraggiungere di un nuovo bit di start. Affinché il clock locale possa scandire con precisione l’evoluzione temporale del segnale ricevuto, occorre che la sua frequenza non si discosti da quella del trasmettitore di una quantità tale da superare la larghezza di un impulso. Tale ipotesi non è assolutamente restrittiva in quanto la perdita di fase dev’essere contenuta solo per l’intervallo di tempo relativo alla trasmissione di una parola. Nella trasmissione sincrona le parole digitali vengono raggruppate in blocchi delimitati da appositi campi, nei quali sono contenuti sia il carattere di sincronismo, sia particolari parole di controllo degli errori e della lunghezza del testo, dipendenti dal protocollo utilizzato. Ciò riduce i tempi di trasmissione perché il carattere di sincronismo è inviato una sola volta per ciascun blocco di messaggi, oppure permane costantemente in linea in assenza di informazioni.

Questi sono: il separatore di sincronismi, il convertitore A/D, il microcontrollore, la SRAM, il generatore di indirizzi, il clock e lo stadio di uscita seriale. Il primo problema da risolvere è determinare quando ha inizio l’immagine da campionare e quando finisce: per limitare lo spreco di memoria è necessario eliminare dalla digitalizzazione gli impulsi di sincronismo e la parte del burst colore lasciando in memoria solo i 320 pixel per ogni riga di un solo semiquadro, il dispari. Per identificare ogni diverso semiquadro, e quindi l’inizio (il primo punto o riga che dir si voglia) di ogni fotogramma è necessario un separatore di sincronismi video e nel caso particolare è stato utilizzato il circuito integrato LM1881 prodotto dalla National Semiconductor, capace, dopo aver selezionato tramite un resistere ed un condensatore esterni per la scelta dello standard video da cui estrarre i segnali di sincronismo. Per agganciare la frequenza di scansione verticale dello standard europeo PAL (Phase Alternating Line) sono sufficienti una resistenza da 470 KΩ ed un condensatore da 100 nF (vedi RI e Cl). In tal modo, è possibile estrarre quattro segnali interpolati in quello video: il sincronismo composito, il sincronismo verticale, l’identificazione del semiquadro pari/ dispari attuale e il sincronismo del burst colore. La rete logica realizzata con opportune porte logiche, permette di operare una semplice funzione booleana sui livelli logici di uscita del LM1881 emettendo un impulso alto solo ed esclusivamente in presenza del segnale dell’immagine e non di burst o sync. Questo segnale è applicato al microcontrollore che gestisce il campionamento. Un secondo problema riguarda la gestione della memoria SRAM. Essa deve accogliere, attivando la propria linea Write Enable, i byte provenienti dall’A/D durante la digitalizzazione del fotogramma e poi questa memoria deve venir letta dal microcontrollore, negando il segnale WE, per lasciar sì che l’immagine venga scaricata sul PC. Fig. 8. Separatore di sincronismi LM1881 pin-out e temporizzazioni del segnale video ricavate da esso. Queste due funzioni devono avvenire a due differenti velocità: La scrittura deve essere sincronizzata al clock di campionamento, quindi a 6 milioni di campioni per secondo; La lettura deve essere sincronizzata alla velocità di upload verso il PC, quindi ad un clock pilotato direttamente dal microcontrollore. A ciò servono le linee Clock Line Select e Clock Lettura. La prima serve per tre funzioni contemporaneamente: il settaggio del modo di lettura/scrittura della memoria, l’attivazione delle uscite del convertitore A/D tramite la linea OE e la selezione della posizione dello switch analogico in modo da scegliere come clock al contatore o il clock diretto a 6 MHz o la frequenza uscente dal pin Clock Lettura. Perché ci necessiti di un clock di 6 MHz è presto detto. Avendo scelto un formato di visualizzazione di 320 pixel/riga, e dato che una riga nel segnale video è stipata in 51 µS, ogni punto dovrà presentarsi in un tempo di 51/320 = 0,159375 µS che corrisponde ad una frequenza di 1 /0,159375 = 6,2745 MHz Ciò significa necessitare di un transfer rate di 6 MB/s, che è quello che si trova nel bus dati che dal convertitore A/D va verso la memoria statica che fa funzione di buffer. Se fosse possibile utilizzare un bus standard per un Personal Computer con tale velocità, si avrebbe la possibilità di trasferire animazioni al posto di singoli fotogrammi, ma per mantenere la compatibilità e l’utilizzo di uno standard praticamente presente in tutti i computer, ho deciso di utilizzare la molto più lenta porta seriale.

Il programma che gestisce il PIC si occupa di attendere l’inizio e la fine del fotogramma tramite il piedino TimIn, gestire la linea Reset del generatore di indirizzi, la linea Clock Line Select, la linea Clock Lettura e la linea di uscita dei dati seriali. Il programma inizia settando la scheda pronta al campionamento dell’imma-gine, lasciando solo la linea di reset del generatore di indirizzi (il contatore) attivata, in modo da bloccare l’indirizzo della memoria su zero e quindi l’avanzamento delle locazioni di memoria. Non appena inizia il fotogramma dispari, controllando la transizione da alto a basso della linea odd/even, il controllore, sganciando il reset del contatore, permette, alla velocità di 6 MHz, di memorizzare ogni punto dell’immagine nelle locazioni della memoria, finché il segnale di stop non si presenta in ingresso: infatti, il microcontrollore deve semplicemente attendere che la linea odd/even transiti a livello positivo; in altre parole deve attendere la fine del primo semiquadro e l’inizio del secondo, fermando così la digitalizzazione invertendo il livello logico del segnale che comanda lo scambiatore di clock e resettando il contatore, A questo punto è sufficiente prelevare il byte sul port b, inviarlo serialmente tramite la routine di trasferimento seriale e far incrementare di una locazione l’indirizzo puntato dal contatore della memoria digitale con un semplice impulso sulla linea di clock del processore che, scambiata dallo switch, arriva direttamente all’ingresso di clock del contatore.

On the other way, making image files smaller is a win for transmitting files across networks (the Internet) and for archiving libraries of images. Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full color image down to, say, 100 Kbytes makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time. Many graphics compression algorithm standard have been written during last year, the most important is JPEG (pronounced “jay-peg”) JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard JPEG can easily provide 20:1 compression ratio but it takes longer to decode and view an image, thus it’s essentially a time/space tradeoff. A lot of people are scared off by the term lossy compression but when it comes to representing real-world scenes, no digital image format can retain all the information that impinges on your eyeball. The real disadvantage of lossy compression is that if you repeatedly compress and decompress an image, you lose a little more quality each time becoming a serious objection for some applications but matters not at all for many others. It would be nice if, having a compressed image with JPEG, you could decompress it, view and manipulate it (crop off the border, say) and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately, this is not the case: in general, recompressing an altered image loses more information. Hence, it’s important to minimize the number of generations of JPEG compression between initial and final versions of an image. But there are a few specialised operations that can be done on a JPEG file without incurring the generational loss that you’d normally get from loading and re-saving the image in a regular image editor. In particular it is possible to do 90-degree rotations and flips lossless but only in particular file format/image size ratios.

It works well on photographs, not so well on line drawing, charts and similar. This algorithm is “lossy” meaning that the decompressed image isn’t quite the same as the one you started with. In fact, JPEG is designed to exploit known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small colour changes are perceived less accurately than small changes in brightness. Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked by humans and if you plan to machine-analyse them, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are quite invisible to the eye. A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of looseness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters directly by the image maker meaning that he can trade off file size against output image quality making, in this way, extremely small files if you don’t mind poor quality or you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accepting lesser compression. JPEG images can be stored in files called JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) saving it in two forms: Baseline JPEG and Progressive JPEG. This is very important while on the Net, because the images in a baseline format are stored as one top-to-bottom scan while progressive format does a series of scans. This implies that while downloading a photo, and assume that only one third of it has been loaded, the first format let us see only a truncated photo at exactly one third of it, leaving under only a blank space; instead, the progressive format let us see the entire frame but at a lesser resolution like it’s blurred, increasing the definition while it’s still downloading, giving the viewer, the ideas about the image if it can be of interesting for him before downloading the entire file, JPEG is only for still images. Nonetheless, you will frequently see references to motion JPEG or MPEG for video. This is the recognised standard for motion picture compression. It uses many of the same techniques as JPEG, but adds mid-frame compression to exploit the similarities that usually exists between successive frames. To do such operation, it needs far more computation to generate the compressed sequence (since detecting visual similarities is hard for a computer) and it’s difficult to edit an MPEG sequence on a frame-by-frame basis (since each frame is intimately tied to the ones around it). This standard can be used, with the needed modifications, also for audio storage applications, having full motion video and/or audio movies stored on disks or Cd roms. Audio is another space consuming data format so the MPEG standard has to be modified, giving it the name of MPEG Layer 3, or MP3, the last frontier in Audio exchange/storage on the Net. Legal Stuff regarding JPEG compression The JPEG Spec defines two different “back-end” modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding and arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 to 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding. Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard, is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT\u0026T and Mitsubishi. Thus, you cannot legally use JPEG arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies. Patent law’s experimental use exception allows people to test a patented method in the context of scientific research, but any commercial or routine personal use is infringement. It’s recommendable that people not use JPEG arithmetic coding: the space savings isn’t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on the Internet.

Like others, mine too was almost completely modified and not officially road-worthy anymore. This is a photograph of the scooter I used to have, onto which this digital tacho was mounted. It’s got a cop motor, a 440 cubic inch plant, it’s got cop tires, cop suspensions, cop shocks. It’s a model made before catalytic converters so it’ll run good on regular gas. What do you say, is it the new Bluesmobile or what? The original tachometer: the digital tacho was installed replacing the analog one. Unfortunately back in the 90s I did not care to take a photo of it with a film camera. Other than having a bigger motor (70cc), a more performant exhaust, air filter, modified continuous variator, modified clutch, sporting crankshaft, 17cm carburettor but it had a home-made digital speedometer. Main Board the main board and a mock-up for the displays. The actual display board I mounted on the scooter has been lost since years. The display board in this picture is a mock-up of what it was originally made and installed inside the scooter’s cockpit instead of the original one. The original idea had to have the gas-gauge, trip and total mileage indication, direction and high-beams indicators included. the main board was hand soldered (I was a teenager at the time) and had to recur to scraped wires to make all the connections. Not to mention that the soldering iron tip was quite big and not thermo-regulated. In fact it was a soldering iron directly connected to 230VAC and had to manually unplug it to avoid overheating.

It had six holes in a row: Calculating the speed, knowing the wheel circumference, could have been done by floating point arithmetic by a decent PIC or ATMEL uC, instead I opted for a simpler shortcut as I had plenty of old EPROM memories at disposal, I found out how I could implement a pair of them to get the calculations done. Done yes, as the results were pre-calculated and stored for the different speed detected by the counter. The six pulses coming from the disc-brake, would have been counted by a CD4040 within a 1 second enable-window controlled by a NE555 monostable. This would have resulted in a 12bit address to fetch the data at that memory locations of two 2764 EPROMS, one for the tenths and one for the units, of the pre-calculated speed. The data present inside the memories was already 7-segment encoded, and ready to be fed though a current buffer to the actual seven-segment displays. Reaching more than 100 km/h was not really possible, but the scooter, with all the modifications and with the right rear-wind down a slope could actually get past that velocity. Using the MSB from each memory location I could use them signals to drive the segments “b, c” on the hundreds digit figure thus saving a lot of components. The solder side of the main board, was a painstakingly task to accomplish, with a brutal soldering iron (surely not a Weller with a fine-tip) looking much more that of an idraulic. I only had spare wires and not consistent in their gauges.
