# Lorena Fontana - A Vision - Making of


This video is the official behind-the-scenes documentary filmed in Los Angeles during the recording sessions of **A Vision**, an original jazz album by Italian vocalist, educator, and composer [Lorena Fontana](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorena_Fontana). I had the opportunity to fully edit and assemble the video, and the result reflects the intimate, professional, and collaborative atmosphere that only top-tier musicians in LA can create.

## The Project

Recorded at the renowned studio of **Dennis Moody**, the production captures the magic of live jazz performance while blending modern vocal arrangements with traditional acoustic instrumentation. 

In summer 2013, I curated the post-production and video editing for the behind-the-scenes footage, offering a window into the real-time interplay of some of LA’s finest jazz artists.
