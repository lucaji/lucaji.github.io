# Fire Makers - Metal Empire


In between my travels I participated as guest keyboard player for a metal-band project while they were recording and releasing their album "Metal Empire", the band name was [Fire Makers](https://www.facebook.com/firemakersmetalband).

I was very impressed by the lead singer, as it turned out he was [Eugent Bushpepa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugent_Bushpepa).

For this recording I played the organ parts on a Roland VK-8 and the piano/synths part on a GEM S3.

I sincerely wish to thank Max "Dingo" Candido for that brief but intense experience.
