# ToneTuna


For some years I worked with and published mobile apps. Albeit mostly on the iOS Apple platform, I ventured into porting onto Android (JAVA, Kotlin) as well.
This post lists the apps I worked on, worth of being published. Make sure you check those open-source ones, as their code is available for download.

Unless otherwise stated, I took care of
- designing all the graphical elements of the apps
- designing the UI/UX
- creating the promo videos
- writing/arranging the musics
- everything else

Another app from the *tuna series: a sine tone generator equipped with a interactive piano-like keyboard able to generate the correct note frequencies for the entire 88 keys of the piano. The catch is that is possible to adjust the concert "A" reference frequency in order to get a different character to the whole piano if you are, like me, into actually tuning acoustic pianos :)
