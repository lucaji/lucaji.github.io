# Campari Dreaming - Honey Ants Jam Session Night


## Crafting the Leaflet: A Night at Bar dello Sport

It all began with a casual evening at **Bar dello Sport** in Serramonacesca, sipping on the iconic Italian drink—[Campari Soda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campari)—amid the warm embrace of local hospitality. Conversations drifted freely among friends and locals, and an idea sparked: designing a unique promotional poster for an upcoming jam session night sponsored by Campari. Fueled by inspiration (and a few rounds of drinks), I eagerly offered my skills as a graphic designer to craft the flyer.

Returning home late that night, ideas flowed vividly in my mind. The bright red of the Campari bottles reminded me strangely yet irresistibly of a distant memory: the honey pot ants, or [*Tjala*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant), that I had encountered in central Australia years earlier. Their swollen abdomens, filled with sweet nectar, vividly resembled miniature Campari bottles—a perfect metaphor for the vibrant and sweet atmosphere the event promised.

## Red Centre Dreaming: Aboriginal Inspiration

The leaflet’s artistic concept blossomed further from a memorable journey into Australia's Red Centre. In November 2008, I had the privilege to explore the desert landscape near [Alice Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs) with [René Kulitja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Kulitja)—a renowned Yankunytjatjara Anangu artist—and her late husband, Richard. René's captivating dot-painting art, celebrated internationally, profoundly influenced my own creative sensibilities. Her famed "Yananyi Dreaming" adorns a Qantas Boeing 737, symbolizing her people's connection to their land and traditions.

My flyer integrated these Aboriginal cultural elements with Italian aesthetics. Using Photoshop, I transformed the honey pot ants into striking, vibrant-red visuals, encapsulating both the essence of Campari Soda and the powerful symbolism of Australian Dreaming stories.

## Serramonacesca: Gateway to the Maiella Mountains

[Serramonacesca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serramonacesca), nestled in Abruzzo’s captivating [Maiella mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiella), provided the perfect backdrop for this unique event. The village itself is steeped in history, tracing its roots back to Lombard settlements. Its charm is enhanced by landmarks such as:

- **[Abbey of San Liberatore a Maiella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_San_Liberatore_a_Majella)**: A stunning example of medieval architecture with intricate Cosmatesque mosaics.
- **[Castel Menardo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Menardo)**: Historic ruins offering panoramic vistas of the surrounding valleys.
- **[Hermitage of Sant’Onofrio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_of_Sant%27Onofrio,_Serramonacesca)**: A spiritual refuge carved into the rocky cliffs, preserving centuries of monastic solitude.

The Maiella mountains beckon adventurers and nature lovers alike, offering trails of varying difficulty:

- **Sentiero dello Spirito**: A spiritual hiking route connecting ancient hermitages.
- **Monte Amaro**: The highest peak, offering challenging hikes with unparalleled views.
- **Orfento Valley Loop**: A tranquil walk through lush woodlands and alongside serene streams.

## Stay and Explore: Kokopelli Camping

For those wishing to extend their visit, the [Kokopelli Camping Retreat](https://www.facebook.com/Kokopelli.Camping) offers eco-friendly accommodations. From tent pitches to comfortable glamping facilities, it provides an ideal base for exploring the surrounding wilderness. Activities like guided meditations, yoga, and forest bathing enrich visitors' experiences, enhancing their connection to the tranquil beauty of Abruzzo.

## A Night to Remember

Despite a heavy downpour on the event night, the Campari Soda Nights jam session at Bar dello Sport was a vibrant success. Live blues and rock music filled the air, resonating perfectly with the fusion of Aboriginal inspiration and Italian conviviality captured in my leaflet.

The journey from conceptualizing the leaflet to seeing it come to life was not just about design; it was a tribute to shared experiences, cultural appreciation, and the unifying power of music and art.
