For some years I worked with and published mobile apps. Albeit mostly on the iOS Apple platform, I ventured into porting onto Android (JAVA, Kotlin) as well.
This post lists the apps I worked on, worth of being published. Make sure you check those open-source ones, as their code is available for download.

> Modern software programs usually known as Apps...

Unless otherwise stated, I took care of
- designing all the graphical elements of the apps
- designing the UI/UX
- creating the promo videos
- writing/arranging the musics
- everything else

PDF reader plus local webDAV server for upload/download of documents. This simple app combines two great open source projects into one:

It has a very nice reader for PDF files, and the addition of the WebDAV server gives the option to directly upload/download files onto the App's local directory on the device is running onto. For those who don't want to use cloud services, but good-old transfer and management of own files and documents.
