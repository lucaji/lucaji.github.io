# Antoine


For some years I worked with and published mobile apps. Albeit mostly on the iOS Apple platform, I ventured into porting onto Android (JAVA, Kotlin) as well.
This post lists the apps I worked on, worth of being published. Make sure you check those open-source ones, as their code is available for download.

> Modern software programs usually known as Apps...

Unless otherwise stated, I took care of
- designing all the graphical elements of the apps
- designing the UI/UX
- creating the promo videos
- writing/arranging the musics
- everything else

# ANTOINE: *that* little Prince ðŸ¤´

![](antoine-appicon.png)

This text reader App implements a pretty new and interactive paradigm to enjoy a written story.

## Feature List

- it encompass the Little Prince's story by Antoine De Saint Exupery in four different languages (limited only by the number of translations available)
- each paragraph of the text can respond to a single touch
- the resulting behaviour can be customized between displaying a different translation in a circular order between all the available ones or
- the displayed language can be alternatively chosen between twos.
- the text color can be customized for each language
- the font size can be customized for each language
- the drawing and figures are presented along the text and by interacting with them, the user is offered a parallax rendition of them, with gyroscopic sensor active
- a shoot-em-all game can be run anytime, on a side-scrolling parallax screen with most of the drawings appearing both as moving background or as bonus/enemies.
- the music during the game changes dynamically style depending on the game conditions.
