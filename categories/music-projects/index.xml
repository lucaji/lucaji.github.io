    <description><![CDATA[<p>Some stories arrive long before the music does. Goats, Tea and Trouble began as a slow-burning tale told under starlightâ€”a dreamlike fable set on Africaâ€™s western coast, where ancient spells, unruly goats, and firelit music blur the line between myth and memory.</p>
<p>This song is the echo of that story: a soundscape born from a nomadâ€™s bonfire, a missing cloth, and the quiet resistance of people who still live by rhythms older than time. Before you listen, read the story that inspired it.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>It was one of those summer mornings when time feels almost paused â€” a tranquil pocket of stillness nestled within the cityâ€™s otherwise relentless pulse. The grass was already warm with sun, and the air carried the scent of cut leaves and waking soil. Beneath the shade of a tall plane tree, a small group had gathered on mats, in silent reverence to breath and body. At the center stood a yoga teacher, her posture fluid, calm, unhurried â€” an embodiment of presence.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="fire-makers--metal-empire">Fire Makers â€“ Metal Empire</h1>
<p>In 2005, during a gap between travels and projects, I had the chance to collaborate as a guest keyboardist for an independent metal band named <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firemakersmetalband" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Fire Makers</a>. They were in the process of recording their debut album <em>Metal Empire</em>, and I was invited to contribute organ, piano, and synthesizer parts on several tracks.</p>
<p>It turned out to be an electrifying and high-adrenaline experience. What struck me most was the stunning voice of their lead vocalist at the timeâ€”none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugent_Bushpepa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Eugent Bushpepa</a>, who would later rise to prominence on international stages.</p>]]></description>
