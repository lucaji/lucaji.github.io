    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a Proof-Of-Concept of an <strong>organ keyboard</strong> using <strong>magnets</strong> instead of springs to obtain a nice upward release action and a decent downward counter-pressure when playing.</p>
<p>Designing a musical-instrument keyboard confronted me with some ergonomics considerations and material choices.
I did some research on magnets as well, to have a better understanding of their force irradiation and how to select them to save space, weight and achieve the best feeling when playing.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="geloso">GELOSO</h1>
<p>Geloso, founded in 1931 by Giovanni Geloso, was an Italian manufacturer of radios, televisions, amplifiers, amateur radio receivers, audio equipment and electronic components. Its headquarters were situated in Milan, Viale Brenta 29.</p>
<p>In 1931 the company started the production not only of radio sets but also most of the electronic components with which they were built and, over time, also developed and patented many others.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, Geloso expanded and expanded his production, becoming from 1950 onwards, a point of reference for enthusiasts of consumer electronics and hobbyists.</p>]]></description>

    <title>DIY Tube Amps Builds ðŸŽ¸</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many many ways to build an amplifier, depending on money and time available, choosing the most expensive components, creating (or again, buy) a custom metal chassis (or have a friend that can make many as you want) with the objective to obtain a better build for the same price.</p>
<p>Building tube amps is very rewarding, and can keep you busy with its fair amount of metalwork and various power tools, like folding machines, press, lathe, milling machines and uncountable hand tools. Finishing the build with spray paint, adding lettering, logos, design elements one can go on forever. Custom shop!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a semi-serious rendition of the story behind the making of this project â€”<br>
a <strong>replica of the Time Circuits from <em>Back to the Future</em></strong>, turned into a <strong>talking alarm clock</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from actual time travel (which may or may not be possible depending on your time zone, ISP, and your ability to construct a <a href="https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Flux_capacitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">flux capacitor</a>), it works beautifully as a nostalgic gadget, delivering iconic quotes from the film.</p>]]></description>

<p>As every teenager could enjoy riding a 50 cubic centimeters (1.7 cubic feet) scooter, I was no exception back in the schooldays. Like others, mine too was almost completely modified and not officially road-worthy anymore.</p>]]></description>
