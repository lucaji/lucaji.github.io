    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a Proof-Of-Concept of an <strong>organ keyboard</strong> using <strong>magnets</strong> instead of springs to obtain a nice upward release action and a decent downward counter-pressure when playing.</p>
<p>Designing a musical-instrument keyboard confronted me with some ergonomics considerations and material choices.
I did some research on magnets as well, to have a better understanding of their force irradiation and how to select them to save space, weight and achieve the best feeling when playing.</p>]]></description>

    <title>DIY Tube Amps Builds üé∏</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many many ways to build an amplifier, depending on money and time available, choosing the most expensive components, creating (or again, buy) a custom metal chassis (or have a friend that can make many as you want) with the objective to obtain a better build for the same price.</p>
<p>Building tube amps is very rewarding, and can keep you busy with its fair amount of metalwork and various power tools, like folding machines, press, lathe, milling machines and uncountable hand tools. Finishing the build with spray paint, adding lettering, logos, design elements one can go on forever. Custom shop!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="di-box">DI Box</h1>
<p>A handcrafted <strong>direct injection box</strong> ‚Äî a compact, AC-powered <strong>audio preamplifier</strong> designed for dynamic microphones, capable of cleanly converting mic-level signals to standard <strong>line-level output (-10dBV)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Class A <strong>FET input stage</strong> with high linearity and extended bandwidth</li>
<li>XLR input with adjustable gain</li>
<li>Balanced or unbalanced <strong>line-level output</strong></li>
<li>Low noise, low distortion performance</li>
<li>Wide frequency response</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-motivation--design-approach">üéôÔ∏è Motivation &amp; Design Approach</h2>
<p>While trying to record audio using a <strong>Shure SM58</strong> dynamic microphone directly into a Mac‚Äôs line-in jack, I encountered the usual issues: low gain, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and uninspiring tone. So, I decided to build my own solution ‚Äî a clean, simple <strong>preamplifier</strong> with tone characteristics I personally enjoy.</p>]]></description>

<p>This is a semi-serious rendition of the story behind the making of this project ‚Äî<br>
a <strong>replica of the Time Circuits from <em>Back to the Future</em></strong>, turned into a <strong>talking alarm clock</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from actual time travel (which may or may not be possible depending on your time zone, ISP, and your ability to construct a <a href="https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Flux_capacitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">flux capacitor</a>), it works beautifully as a nostalgic gadget, delivering iconic quotes from the film.</p>]]></description>

    <title>The Leslie Speaker</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>This article explains the principles behind Leslie-type loudspeakers and goes on to describe the construction of a generously proportioned system intended for use with a home constructed electronic organ. The article could provide the starting point from which individual readers could build up a rotating loudspeaker system to suit their own particular requirements.</p></blockquote>
<h1 id="rotating-system-loudspeakers-for-electronic-organs">Rotating System Loudspeakers for Electronic Organs</h1>
<p>The most obvious and the routine method of radiating sound from an electronic organ is by means of one or more loudspeakers, suitably and conventionally baffled. In a single-unit instrument, the loudspeaker(s) are mounted behind cutouts, usually in the front panel below the keyboard and above the pedal clavier.
While compact and convenient, this arrangement usually suffers some limitation in the effectiveness of the baffling which can be provided and the efficiency with which the sound can be propagated.</p>]]></description>

<p>As every teenager could enjoy riding a 50 cubic centimeters (1.7 cubic feet) scooter, I was no exception back in the schooldays. Like others, mine too was almost completely modified and not officially road-worthy anymore.</p>]]></description>
