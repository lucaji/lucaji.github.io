<p>This fork introduces an additional web-dashboard driven by a <em>sqlite</em> database to keep track of temperature and humidity readings coming from a HDC1080 sensor. This dashboard is accessible by the main page of the camera preview bringing in some statistics of the collected data.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Data Logger for Electrical Power Measurements</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>Measuring power (consumption or supplied) in certain electric (and electronic) appliances or projects sometimes requires very long running times. Some might even last for days or more.
Having a software tool that can reliabily take care of storing the measured data and plot some nice graphs and even export the whole data-set is a great deal of help. Especially when such software can be customized to fulfill any kind of requirements.</p>]]></description>
