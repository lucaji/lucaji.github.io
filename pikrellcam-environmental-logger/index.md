## Motion Detection with Sensor Data Logger

> One of the most used motion detection and surveillance software for the Raspberry Pi with additional temperature and humidity logging and graph panel.


{{< image src="logger_screenshot_01.jpg" caption="Sensor Logger UI panel." >}}



This fork introduces an additional web-dashboard driven by a *sqlite* database to keep track of temperature and humidity readings coming from a HDC1080 sensor. This dashboard is accessible by the main page of the camera preview bringing in some statistics of the collected data.



It is aimed at:

- tracking sensor data;
- keeping the original motion detection component alive and updated;
- improve its original web interface with modern components;
- building a nice dashboard for one or more sensors (via I2C interface or external ESP32s);

## Current state (work in progress)

October 2022
- Changed most (if not all) of the original source code indentation style ;)
- Updated web components with recent versions (jQuery)
- Introducing bootstrap CSS for the logger dashboard and the main interface
- Added working support to a single HDC1080 temperature and humidity sensor via Python over I2C interface

{{< admonition type="danger" >}}
The legacy camera interface has been deprecated from  Raspbian OS.
Future version will need to be totally rewritten.

## Logger Dashboard

The original PHP code from [raspberry_temperature_log](https://github.com/DzikuVx/raspberry_temperature_log) written by Pawe≈Ç Spychalski has been adapted to be used within this project.

## Legacy Version

PiKrellCam is an audio/video recording motion detect program with an OSD web
interface that detects motion using the Raspberry Pi camera MMAL motion vectors.


## Source Code

The [repo](https://github.com/lucaji/pikrellcam) contains the source code.
